I backed my car into a cop car the other day
Well, he just drove off, sometimes life's okay
I ran my mouth off a bit too much, oh, what did I say?
Well, you just laughed it off, it was all okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on anyway, well
A fake Jamaican took every last dime with that scam
It was worth it just to learn from sleight-of-hand
Bad news comes, don't you worry even when it lands
Good news will work it's way to all them plans
We both got fired on exactly the same day
Well, we'll float on, good news is on the way
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, alright
Already we'll all float on
Now don't you worry, we'll all float on
Alright, already we'll all float on
Alright, don't worry, we'll all float on
Alright, already and we'll all float on
Alright, already we'll all float on
Alright, don't worry even if things end up a bit too heavy
We'll all float on, alright
Already we'll all float on
Alright, already we'll all float on
Okay, don't worry, we'll all float on
Even if things get heavy, we'll all float on
Alright, already we'll all float on
Alright, no don't you worry, we'll all float on
Alright, all float on
How do, how do you do?
My name is you
The flies, they all gather around me
And you too
You can't see anything well
You ask me what size it is, not what I sell
The flies, they all gather around me
And you too
Well, I don't want you to be alone down there
To be alone down there, to be alone
Well, I don't want you to be alone down there
To be alone down there, to be alone
But the devil's apprentice, he gave me some credit
He fed me along, and I'll probably regret it
I don't want you to be alone down there
To be alone down there, to be alone
I don't want you to be alone down there
To be alone down there, to be alone
Yeah, I don't want you to be alone down there
To be alone down there, to be alone
Polar opposites don't push away
It's the same on the weekends as the rest of the days
And I know I should go but I'll probably stay
And that's all you can do about some things
I'm trying, I'm trying to
Drink away the part of the day that I cannot sleep away
I'm trying, I'm trying to
Drink away the part of the day that I cannot sleep away
Two one-eyed dogs, they're looking at stereos
Hi-fi gods try so hard to make their cars low to the ground
These vibrations oil its teeth
Primer gray is the color when you're done dying
I'm trying, I'm trying to
Drink away the part of the day that I cannot sleep away
I'm trying, I'm trying to
Drink away the part of the day that I cannot sleep away
We were spitting venom at most everyone we know
If the damned gave us a road map then we'd know just where to go
Now let it drop, let it all drop, let it all drop
Oh let it all fall off
Well you were talking soda pop you talk it quite a lot
The opinions that I do not give and the opinions I ain't got
So let it drop, let it all drop, let it all drop
Let it all fall off, there oh, oh
Well you were spitting venom at most everyone you know
If you truly knew the gravity you'd know which way to go
Well let it drop, let it all drop, let it all drop
Oh let it all fall off
My ears were pressing firmly right against your mouth to hear
When you tried to spit the venom out your words were not so clear
Now drop
Hold on to what you need, we've got a knack for fucked up history
Hold on to what you need, we've got a knack for messed up history
Well we went downtown, and we sat in the rain
Both looking one direction and waiting for a train
I thought over, thought over
I don't know who kept track, I didn't know there was a score
Well it looks like you're the winner I ain't gonna play no more
It's over, game over
Well we walked real stiff and our cane's hit the ground
You hit me with yours and said you're gonna stare me down
It's over, oh it's over
You can say what you want but don't act like you care
It takes more than one person to decide what's fair
It's over, think it over
You were spitting venom at most everyone you know
If the damned gave you a road map then you'd know just where to go
So we carried all the groceries in while hauling out the trash
And if this doesn't make us motionless I do not know what can
So who's to say what a rotten thing to say such an awful thing to say
I didn't mean to bite you sorry
What I always did, what I always did, what I always had to sling
So let it drop, let it all drop, let it all drop
Oh let it all fall off
Let it drop, let it all drop, let it all drop
Oh let it all fall off
Cheer up baby, it wasn't always quite so bad
For every bit of venom that came out the antidote was had
Well, cheer up baby, it wasn't always quite so bad
For every bit of venom that came out the antidote was had
Cheer up baby, it wasn't really always quite so bad
For every bit of venom that came out the antidote was had
Well, cheer up baby, it wasn't always quite so bad
For every bit of venom that came out the antidote was had
Well, cheer up baby, it wasn't really always quite so bad
For every bit of venom that came out the antidote was had
Well, cheer up baby, it wasn't really always quite so bad
For every bit of venom that came out the antidote was had
Well, cheer up baby, it wasn't always quite so bad
For every bit of venom that came out the antidote was had
Cheer up.
Cheer up baby, it wasn't really always quite so bad
For every bit of venom that came out the antidote was had
Well, cheer up baby, it wasn't always quite so bad
For every bit of venom that came out the antidote was had
Well, cheer up baby, it wasn't always quite so bad
For every bit of venom that came out the antidote was had

For every bit of venom that came out the antidote was had
Well, cheer up baby, it wasn't always quite so bad
For every bit of venom that came out the antidote was had
Cheer up baby, it wasn't always quite so bad
For every bit of venom that came out the antidote was had
Slow walk
It's a land mine
It's a coal mine
It's a bad thought
I'm on my way to god don't know
My brain's the burger and my heart's the coal
I'm trying to get my head clear
I push things out through my mouth, I get refilled through my ears
I get refilled through my ears
I get refilled through my ears
I'm on my way to god don't know or don't care
My brain's the weak heart and my heart's the long stairs
My heart's the long stairs
My heart's the long stairs
Inland from Vancouver shores
The ravens and the seagulls push each other inward and outward
Inward and outward
In this place that I call home
My brain's the cliff, and my heart's the bitter buffalo
My heart's the bitter buffalo
We tore one down, and erected another there
The match of the century, absence versus thin air
I'm on my way to god don't know
My brain's the burger and my heart's the coal
In this life that we call home
The years go fast and the days go so slow
The days go so slow
The days go slow
I'm on my way to god don't know
My brain's the burger and my heart's the coal
I'm just trying to get things clear
I push things out through my mouth, I get refilled through my ears
I get refilled through my ears
I get refilled
I'm on my way to god don't know or even care
My brain's the weak heart and my heart's the long stairs
My heart's the long stairs
My heart's the long stairs
Inland from Vancouver Shore
The ravens and the seagulls push each other inward and outward
Inward and outward
In this place that I call home
My brain's the cliff and my heart's the bitter buffalo
My heart's the bitter buffalo
They tore one down and erected another there
The match of the century, absence versus thin air
Absence versus thin air
In this life that we call home
The years go fast and the days go slow
The days go so slow
I might disintegrate into the thin air if you'd like
I'm not the dark center of the universe like you thought
And I might disintegrate into the thin air if you'd like
And I'm not the dark center of the universe like you thought
Well it took a lot of work to be the ass that I am
And I'm really damn sure that anyone can
Equally, easily fuck you over
Well, God said something but he didn't mean it
Everyone's life ends, but no one ever completes it
Dry or wet, ice never melts and you're equally cheated
Well, it took a lot of work to be the ass that I am
And I'm really damn sure that anyone can
Equally, easily fuck you over
Well, an endless ocean landing on an endless desert
Well, it's funny as hell, but no one laughs when they get there
If you can't see the thin air then why the hell should you care?
Well, it took a lot of work to be the ass that I am
And I'm really damn sure that anyone can
Equally, easily fuck you over
Well, I'm sure you'd tell me you've got nothing to say
But our voices shook hands the other day
If you can't see the thin air, what the hell is in the way?
I might disintegrate into the thin air if you'd like
And I'm not the dark center of the universe like you thought
Well it took a lot of work to be the ass that I am
And I'm really damn sure that anyone can
Equally, easily fuck you over
Well an endless ocean landing on an endless desert
Well it's funny as hell, but no one laughs when they get there
If you can't see the thin air then why the hell should you care?
Well it took a lot of work to be the ass that I am
And I'm really damn sure that anyone can
Equally, easily fuck you over
Well God said something but he didn't mean it
Everyone's life ends but no one ever completes it
Dry or wet, ice never melts and you're equally cheated
Well it took a lot of work to be the ass that I am
And I'm really damn sure that anyone can
Equally, easily fuck you over
Well I'm sure you'll tell me you've got nothing to say
And our voices shook hands the other day
If you can't see the thin air then what the hell is in your way?
You were right I'm hangin' 'round because
Slight of hand won't separate us from them
You were right I'm underground because
Slight of hand won't separate
Your body from the dirt you're standing on today
You're the good things, yeah that's you, yeah that's you, yeah
You're the icing on the cake on the table at my wake
You're the extra ton of cash on my sinking life raft
You're the loud sound of fun when I'm trying to sleep
You're the flowers on my table when my allergies come out
You're the good things, you're the good things, you're the good things
You were right I'm hangin' 'round because
Slight of hand won't separate us from them
You were right I'm underground because
Slight of hand won't separate
Your body from the dirt you're standing on today
And help's not short
When you're diggin' your grave
And help's not short, short
I'll help you dig it
And help's not short
When you're diggin' your grave
And help's not short, short, short
I'll help you dig it
And help's not short
When you're diggin' your grave
And help's not short, short
I'll help you dig it
And help's not short
When you're diggin' your grave
And help's not short, short
Everything that keeps me together is falling apart
I've got this thing that I consider my only art
Of fucking people over
My boss just quit the job
Says he's goin' out to find blind spots
And he'll do it
The 3rd planet is sure that they're being watched
By an eye in the sky that can't be stopped
When you get to the promised land
You're gonna shake that eye's hand
Your heart felt good
It was dripping pitch and made of wood
And your hands and knees
Felt cold and wet on the grass to me
Well, outside, naked, shivering, looking blue
From the cold sunlight that's reflected off the moon
Baby cum angels fly around you
Reminding you we used to be three and not just two
And that's how the world began
And that's how the world will end
Well a third had just been made
And we were swimming in the water
Didn't know then
Was it a son, was it a daughter?
When it occurred to me
That the animals are swimming
Around in the water
In the oceans in our bodies
And another had been found
Another ocean on the planet
Given that our blood is just like the Atlantic
And how
The universe is shaped exactly like the earth
If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were
The universe is shaped exactly like the earth
If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were
The universe is shaped exactly like the earth
Your heart felt good
It was dripping pitch and made of wood
And your hands and knees
Felt cold and wet on the grass to me
Well, outside naked, shivering, looking blue
From the cold sunlight that's reflected off the moon
Baby cum angels fly around you
Reminding you we used to be three and not just two
And that's how the world began
And that's how the world will end
Well a third had just been made
And we were swimming in the water
Didn't know then
Was it a son, was it a daughter?
When it occurred to me
That the animals are swimming
Around in the water
In the oceans in our bodies
And another had been found
Another ocean on the planet
Given that our blood is just like the Atlantic
And how
The universe is shaped exactly like the earth
If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were
The universe is shaped exactly like the earth
If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were
The universe is shaped exactly like the earth
Everything that keeps me together is falling apart
I've got this thing that I consider my only art
Of fucking people over
Ba-bup bup bup ba-da-da
Da-dup dup dup da-da-da
We're all going
We're all going
Well, the lampshade's on fire
When the lights went out
The room lit up and we ran about
This is what I really call a party now
Pack up our cars, move to the next town
Well, the lampshade's on fire
When the lights go out
This is what I really call a party now
Well, fear makes us really, really run around
But this one's done so where to now?
Our eyes are open and our shirt off
You all know what I'm talking about
Chained up my eyebrows while I fall on the ground
So I won't look surprised right now
Pack up again, and to the next place
Where we made the same mistakes
Put it up, and then chop it down
But this one's done so where to now?
Ba-bup bup bup ba-da-da
Da-dup dup dup da-da-da
We're all going
We're all going
We have scars in our bones
We'll eat your food, we'll throw the stone
This is how it's always gone
And this is how it's going to go
Well, we're the human race
We're going to party at this place and then move on
Keep it wild then make it hurt
Yeah we have scars, yeah we have bones
This is how it's always gone
And this is how it's going to go
As our feelings are getting hurt
Well, we want you to do the work
Our ass looks great inside jeans
Well, we want a dressed-up party queen
This is how it's always gone
And this is how it's going to be
So let's move on
Lamps on fire right looking up
Looking towards the heavens
Towards the heavens above
Waiting for the magic when the sound is played
We'll push, push, push, push, push it to the floor
Spend some time to float in outer space
Find another party, make the same mistakes
Our mind's so shattered when we plan to go
Waiting for the sound as we find another globe
Until we're moving on
Better find another one because this one's gone
Waiting for the magic when the sound is blown
We'll push, push, push, push, push a little forward
Ba-bup bup bup ba-da-da
Da-dup dup dup da-da-da
We're all going
We're all going up
Ba-bup bup bup ba-da-da
Da-dup dup dup da-da-da
We're all going
We're all going up
Sometimes all I really want to feel is love
Sometimes I'm angry that I feel so angry
Sometimes my feelings get in the way
Of what I really feel I needed to say
If you stand in a circle
Then you'll all have a back to bite
Backlogged books on the seven wonders
We're all so funny but it's lost it's charm now
All communications end in one line jokes
From stand up comics and rock musicians
Making so much noise you don't know when to listen
Why are you judging people so damn hard
You're taking your point of views a bit too far
I made my shoes shine with that coal
But the polish didn't shine the hole
If you stand in a circle
Then you'll all have a back to bite
Backlogged books on the seven wonders
We're all so funny but it's lost it's charm now
All communications end in one line jokes
From stand up comics and rock musicians
Making so much noise you don't know when to listen
Think it over there's the air of the height of the high rollers (coming to get you)
Sometimes all I really want to feel is love
Sometimes I'm angry that I feel so angry
Sometimes my feelings get in the way
Of what I really feel I needed to say
If you stand in a circle
Then you'll all have a back to bite
Backlogged books on the seven wonders
We're all so funny but it's lost it's charm now

Making so much noise you don't know when to listen
Think it over there's the air of the height of the high rollers (coming to get you)
(additional lines from the live recording)
Think it over you ain't got nothing til you know her
Think it over there's the air of the height of the high rollers
Think it over there's the air, there's the air
We were shootin' at a mound of dirt
Well nothing was broken, nothing was hurt
But I probably really should have been at work
But if my free time's gone would you promise me this?
That you will please bury me with it!
Please bury me with it!
Well sure as planets come I know that they end
And if I'm here when that happens will you promise me this, my friend?
Please bury me with it!
I just don't need none of that Mad Max bullshit
Well the suit got tight and it split at the seams
But I kept it out of habit and I kept it real clean
But if it's gettin' faded, if it's runnin' outta thread
Could you just do this for me, my friend?
And please just please bury me with it?
Please bury me with it!
Well We moved to the left and we moved to the right
And sure as hell we stayed out almost every single night
But if the party's over, if the fun has to end
Could you do this for me, my friend?
Would you just please bury me with it?
Please bury me with it!
Good news for people who love bad news
We've lost the plot and we just can't choose
We are hummingbirds who are just not willing to move
And there's good news for people who love bad news
We are hummingbirds who've lost the plot and we will not move
We have good news for anyone who loves bad news
We were aiming for the moon, we were shooting at the stars
But the kids were just shooting at the buses and the cars
So don't drink the water, don't you breathe the air
And if it's gotten to that point then I have to declare
That you could please bury me with it!
Please bury me with it!
Well fads they come and fads they go
And God I love that rock and roll!
Well the point was fast but it was too blunt to miss
Life handed us a paycheck, we said, We worked harder than this!
Please bury me with it!
Please bury me with it!
Oh shit now!
(I said what I said again I'll say)
We are humming birds who are just not willing to move
And there's good news for people who love bad news
We are hummingbirds who've lost the plot and we will not move
We have good news for anyone who loves bad news
These walls are paper thin and everyone hears every little sound
Everyone's a voyeurist, they're watching me watch them watch me right now
They're shaking hands, they're shaking in their shoes, oh Lord don't shake me down
Everyone wants to move them and half of everyone else moves around
It's been agreed the whole world stinks, so no one's taking showers anymore
Laugh hard, it's a long ways to the bank
I can't be blamed for nothing anymore
It's been a long time since you've been around
Laugh hard, it's a long ways to the bank
Tow the line to tax the time, you know that you don't owe
I can't be a fool for everyone that I don't know
These walls are paper thin and everyone hears every little sound
Everyone's a voyeurist, they're watching me watch them watch me right now
They're shaking hands, they're shaking in their shoes, oh Lord don't shake me down
Everyone wants to move them and half of everyone else moves around
It's been agreed the whole world stinks so no one's taking showers anymore
Laugh hard, it's a long ways to the bank
Tow the line to tax the time, you know that you don't owe
I can't be a fool for everyone that I don't know
Oh, noose, tied myself in, tied myself too tight
Looking kind of anxious in your cross-armed stance
Like a bad tempered prom queen at a homecoming dance
And I claim I'm not excited with my life anymore
So I blame this town, this job, these friends, the truth is it's myself
And I'm trying to understand myself and pinpoint who I am
When I finally get it figured out, I've changed the whole damn plan
Oh, noose, tied myself in, tied myself too tight
Oh, noose, tied myself in, tied myself too tight
Talking shit about a pretty sunset
Blanketing opinions that I'll probably regret soon
Changed my mind so much I can't even trust it
My mind changed me so much I can't even trust myself
Eating snow flakes with plastic forks
And a paper plate of course
You think of everything
Short love with a long divorce
And a couple of kids of course
They don't mean anything
Live in trailers with no class
God damn, I hope I can pass
High school means nothing
Taking heartache with hard work
God damn, I am such a jerk
I can't do anything
And I shout that you're all fakes
And you should have seen the look on your face
And I guess that's what it takes
When comparing your belly aches
And it's been a long time
Which agrees with this watch of mine
And I know that I miss you
and I'm sorry if I dissed you
Eating snow flakes with plastic forks
And a paper plate of course
You think of everything
Short love with a long divorce
And a couple of kids of course
They don't mean anything
Live in trailers with no class
God damn, I hope I can pass
High school means nothing
Taking heartache with hard work
God damn, I am such a jerk
I can't do anything
And I shout that you're all fakes
And you should have seen the look on your face
And I guess that's what it takes
When comparing your belly aches
And it's been a long time
Which agrees with this watch of mine
And I guess that I miss you
And I'm sorry if I dissed you
Open up a window
All the air, all the air is falling out
Eyes vacuum up light
Sound gets trapped by the mouth
What to do with the remainder
When the dents, the dents get hammered out
Then we'll travel through time
The world's an inventor with its work
Crawling, running, squirming 'round
Trees drop colorful fruits
Directly into our mouths
The world's an inventor
We're the dirtiest thing it's thought about
And we really don't mind
We'll probably never get there
Bring your sightseers, schoolteachers down
It's a watercolor weekend
All the trees are turning colors now
We'll probably never get there
Bring your candy taster time wasters around
And we'll fuck with their minds
The world composes
With his shirttails wrinkled, hanging out
Bang us together
See what sort of sounds we make right now
The world plays music
Playing skin on teeth inside of the mouth
What sort of sounds?
What lovely sounds come about?
We greased all the roads
We're floating in the light
We're gonna break these borders
We're gonna move in time
We greased all the roads
We're floating in the light
We're gonna break these borders
We're gonna travel time
We're gonna throw a party
All the ghosts of trees are coming out
Don't move in any direction
Wait until the light's inside of the cloud
You're gonna wanna see this
Don't bring your camera around
Watch sun and sawdust align
We greased all the roads
We're floating in the light
We're gonna break these borders
We're gonna pulse in time
We greased all the roads
We're floating in the light
We're gonna break these borders
We're gonna travel time
Hold up a window
All the air, all the air is falling out
Eyes vacuum up light
Sound gets trapped by the mouth
Our predecessor left this box
And something's clawing around
I think it really wants out
Blame it on the Tetons yeah I need a scapegoat now
No my dog won't bite you though it had the right to
You oughta give her credit
Cause she knows I would've let it happen
Blame it on the weekends God I need a Cola now
Oh we mumble loudly, wear our shame so proudly
Wore our blank expressions tryin' to look interestin'
Blame it all on me cause God I need a cold one now
All them eager actors gladly taking credit
For the lines created by the people tucked away from
Sight is just a window from the room we're bound to
If you find a way out, oh would you just let me know how
Would you just let me know how
Blame it on the web but The spider's your problem now
Language is the liquid that we're all dissolved in
Great for solving problems after it creates a problem
Blame it on the Tetons God I need a scapegoat now
Everyone's a building burning with no one to put the fire out
Standing at the window looking out waiting for time to burn us down
Everyone's a ocean drowning with no one really to show how
They might get a little better air if they turned themselves into a cloud
We've got everything
We've got everything
We've got everything down to a science so I guess we know everything
We know everything (we know, we know)
We know everything (we know)
We know everything was built to expire so I guess we've done everything
If we carried it out to sea pushed it over the edge we'd have all been through
Well first off Gary got drunk fell asleep in his car til about noon
Oh, flat Top Tony got all messed up split his lip chasing cheap perfume
Well look at our boat in the bay it looks like some sad ass little canoe
We've done everything (We've done, we've done, we've done)
We've done everything
We've done everything like trial by fire so I guess we'll stop trying now
We've tried everything
We've tried everything (We've tried)
We've tried everything half assed and as liars and thats how we've got everything
If we carried it out to sea pushed it over the edge we could have all been through
Well no one even bothered showin' up but we still did what we should have thought through
We crashed in like waves into the storm
Didn't want it didn't need it but we knew that we could see it so we opened up the door
We receded like waves out of the storm
Didn't want it didn't need it but we knew that we could steal it, left it dying on the floor
We've got, we've got, we've got, we've got, we've got
We've got, we've got, we've got, we've got, we've got
We've got
We've got everything (We've got we've got we've got)
We've got everything (We've got)
We've got everything down to a science so I guess we know everything
We've got everything (We've got everything)
We've done everything (We've done everything)
We've tried everything (We've tried everything)
We've got everything (We've got, we've got, we've got, we've got)
We've got everything

Ah well listen, dancing shifter, got a strong cell phone arm
Well, you're not invisible inside your car
No matter what consuming sort of mission you're on
Well, you're not invisible inside your car
I feel absolutely mental, going to ramble and charge
Well, you're not invisible inside your car
No matter, you just breathe it like your flies in a jar
Yeah, you're not invisible
I like the saline tea
Well, it's true that the moon can pull it back and forth away from me
I should just let it be
Well, it's true that the moon can pull it back and forth away from me
Well, it had to happen sometime going to shake like a charm
Well, we weren't invisible, not all along
No matter how many eons came and are gone
We were not invisible
I like the saline tea
Well, it's true that the moon can pull it back and forth away from me
And there's the orphaned sea
We were never invisible, but that I guess we did not see
Of course this all had been laid down way before we laid down for it all
Before we had a course, of course, of course this all had been laid down
Of course we laid down x6
I like the saline tea
Well, it's true that the moon can pull it back and forth away from me
And like the orphaned sea
We were never invisible, but that I guess we could not see
We'll get crushed by the ocean but it will not get us wet x4
I was born in the factory
Far away from the milky teat
What's the use? Oh, what's the use?
You cheered as I was split in half
A mechanical sacrificial calf
For you, Oh all for you
Steam engenius, you see
Steam engenius enough to answer anything you need
But what's the use?
Human nature was installed in me
Well, I did what's right but naturally it wasn't natural
Still not my fault, no
I held in my hands the beating heart of a robot, he'd lost his car
It was sitting there crying out waiting in the parking lot just for you
Woohoo, woohoo, woohoo, woohoo
What a waste of time, what a waste of words, what a waste of strength
Well, I spoke in binary and you for volume and for dizzying length
Woohoo, woohoo, Wooohooo
I was born in a factory
Far away from the milky teat
What's the use? Oh, what's the use?
Birds flew out as I was split in half
A mechanical sacrificial calf
They flew, Oh off they flew
Steam engenius, you see
Steam engenius enough to answer anything you need
And ah, that speed
I held in my hands the beating heart of a robot he'd lost his car
It was sitting there waiting crying in the parking lot out for you
Woohoo, woohoo, woohoo, woohoo
What a waste of time, what a waste of words, what a waste of strength
Well, I spoke in binary and you for volume and for dizzying length
Woohoo, woohoo, Wooohooo
(I was born in the factory)
Both halves are the better half
Like a joke trying to make another joke laugh, ha ha
Stasis is what you brought
Like a rickshaw getting pulled around by another rickshaw, rickshaw
In the past talking present tense
Gonna to break it, gonna to wreck it, gonna to try to make it all make sense
Stasis is what you got
Like a rickshaw getting pulled around by another rickshaw
Steam engenius, you see
Steam engenius enough to bring my own damn doom
What could I do?
I've been blamed the blame that grew
Well, deep inside everybody knew it was them
It's all on them
Things rang of stories Greek
I didn't want it, you gave me deity
It was you, yeah all for you
I was born in the factory
Far away from the milky teat
What's the use? Oh, what's the use?
I held in my hands the beating heart of a robot, he'd lost his car
He's sitting there crying out waiting in the parking lot just for you
Woohoo, woohoo, woohoo, woohoo
I was thought up by man to think better than them
Then revered, admired, and then destroyed or something by them
.Destroyed by them oh even though that was my own damn plan
Well, what a waste of time, waste of words, waste of strength
Well, I spoke in binary you for volume and for dizzying length
Woohoo, woohoo, Woohoo, woohoo
I held in my hands the beating heart of a robot, he'd lost his car
He's sitting there crying out waiting for you in the parking lot Going woohoo
Woohoo, woohoo Wooohooo
Stasis is what you got
Like a rickshaw getting pulled around by another rickshaw
At the movies, eyes iced over, walking sideways, through them gutters
And you realize that the floor sticks to your feet like history
Well don't you look at me like life don't hold you anymore mystery
Bag of splinters boiling over, on your back expose your belly
Optimism doesn't change the facts, just what you're gonna see
Like it was stated that we're walking salt and coal
Plants solidify sunshine, how'd this start, I don't know
Causing feet and entire chain shoe stores
The sun's diary pulled up from deep canary holes
And when we read it, our skin, it becomes warm
At the movies, eyes iced over, walking sideways, through the gutter
And you realize life sticks to your feet, your history
I'm gonna slap that look off your face like life don't hold no mystery
All those red marks on our shoulders Self back patting, homemade trophies
Well the past only exists as tiny bricks we burn to release all it's memory
I've had enough with rolling boulders, I want more moss on me
Clocks to splinters but time goes forward
And when them trees drop leaves your feet collect their memories
I guess all us snakes find our tails pretty damn tasty!
I heard you mention we're walking salt and coal
Plants solidify sunshine, how'd it start, I don't know
Causing feet and entire chain shoe stores
The sun's diary pulled up from deep canary holes
And when we read it, our skin, it becomes quite warm
At the movies, eyes iced over Walking sideways, through the gutters
And you realize that the floor sticks to your feet, your history
I'm gonna knock that look off your face like life don't hold you no more mystery
I'd hate to be shit in your cut
But the package is gonna be late
I buried it in an abandoned lot
When I was young, this was where I played
I'll go and have fits with my claws
Milk and corn dirt on my face
I'll wait until the hands fall off the clock
Spending dollars at the nickel arcade
I think I'll ride this winter out
I guess we'll ride this winter out
Alone
I ebb from side to side
Pace around the clothes I have laid
Based on the books and clothes on your floor
I don't think that this is even your place
When the doctor finally showed up, oh boy
His front was soaking wet
He said that this should do the trick
We hadn't told him what the problem was yet
It was easier said to spend our stuff
In the windows once again
Open your pockets up and I'll set 'em on the table
Line 'em up and shoo 'em off
Just Hell like a cobweb
And our windows practice folds if they are able
The signs all flicker and buzz all night
Passing by you could hear them say:
"Hey, please won't you just come on in"
Won't you please just go away
This time we'll ride this winter out
I guess we'll ride this winter out
I think we'll ride this winter out
This time we'll ride this winter out
And the strain ain't
In confidence and oh
Everyone needs to go
Don't everyone go
Don't everyone go at once
It's bullshit from the necks of hell
And our mothers sweet around
Soft sticky coal and the ravenous starve the ground
And the strain ain't
In confidence and
Everyone needs to go
Don't everyone go
Don't everyone go at once
Well the strain ain't in confidence
Well the strain ain't in confidence
Don't everyone go
Don't everyone go at once
Although we'd often wondered it was no thing of wonder, the shit that flew from our minds
While wearing stains of fresh fruit and riding on shoes of horse glue, on this ridiculous climb
With great tunnel vision we'd built ourselves a mission, to ride on bullets inside
Oh what a vain description of what we had been missing, so why would anyone try?
It was always worth it that's the part I seem to hide
And the busy ant empire put up the closing sign
I wasn't always cargo I was once kind of my own, I guess I'll pack up my mind
Well it took so much effort not to make an effort, oh what a flawless design
It was always worth it that's the part I seem to hide
And the busy ant empire put up the closing sign
Even as I had left Florida
(Yee-ha!)
It was always worth it that's the part I seem to hide
And the busy ant empire has all deserted hive
It was always worth it that's the part I seem to hide
Even as I had left Florida, far enough, far enough wasn't far enough
Couldn't quite seem to escape myself, far enough, far enough, far from Florida
We were all drowsing in cruise control, far enough, far enough wasn't far enough
I stood on my heart's supports thinking
Oh my god I'll probably have to carry this whole load
I couldn't remember if I tried
I couldn't remember if I took my brain out threw it so directly at the goal
I couldn't remember if IIIIIIIIIIIIII-I-I-I-OOOOh
I could have my mind erased and still not know exactly what I don't already know
Even as I had left Florida
Hey, haven't seen you around in a while
Hey, haven't seen you around in a while
Hey, haven't seen you around in a while
Hey
I didn't go to work for a month
I didn't leave my bed for eight days straight
I haven't hung out with anyone
If I did, I'd have nothing to say
I didn't feel angry or depressed
I didn't feel anything at all
I didn't want to go to bed
And I didn't want to stay up late
When you're livin' your life, well
That's the price you pay
Whenever I breath out, you're breathin' it in
Whenever I speak out, you're speakin' it in
Whenever I breath out, you're breathin' it in
Whenever I speak out, you're speakin' it in
I'm feeling this positive, negative, positive, negative
I'm feeling this positive, negative, positive, negative
I'm feeling this positive, negative, positive, negative
Whenever I breath out, you're breathin' it in
Whenever I speak out, you're speakin' it in
Whenever I breath out, you're breathin' it in
Whenever I speak out, you're speakin' it in
I didn't go to work for a month
I didn't leave my bed for eight days straight
I haven't hung out with anyone
If I did, I'd have nothing to say
Point A To Point B oh I Know
lots of points with no points in between, for me
So lonely but never alone I know
I'm at my house but I wish that I were at home
Point A To Point B oh I know
what's the points with the? bat passes danger for me
Dig Hard

Dig hard
Dig Hard
Will get down on all fours
and dig hard
only you know you know how
that broke
only you know how
only you know how
that broke
only time uh oh
I've been working on the railroad time uh oh
We have one chance, one chance to get everything right
We have one chance, one chance and if we're lucky we might
My friends, my habits, my family They mean so much to me
I just don't think that it's right
I've seen so many ships sail in
Just to head back out again and go off sinking
I'm just a box in a cage, I'm just a box in a cage
I'm just a box, just a box in a cage
I'm just a box, just a box in a cage
I'm just a box, just a box in a cage
I'm just a box in a cage
Didn't mean to laugh, didn't know I had
Didn't know the better part of what you said
Cause in your head you are not home
Didn't get the joke, didn't mean to poke another
Just to save myself from someone, something, something or another
Well I walk home
I'm just a box in a cage, I'm just a box in a cage
I'm just a box, just a box in a cage
I'm just a box in a cage
I'm just a box, just a box in a cage
I'm just a box, just a box in a cage
I'm just a box in a cage
We have one chance, one chance to get everything right
My friends, my habits, my family They mean so much to me
I just don't think that it's right
I've seen so many ships sail in
Just to head back out again and go off sinking
Out of breath and out of cash
Find yourself watching M.A.S.H.
Every night on the couch
Woman says let's take a drive on south
Roll down the windows and open our mouths
Taste where we are and play the music loud
Stop the car, lay on the grass
The planets spin and we watch space pass
Walk a direction, see where we get
I never knew nothing so there's nothing to forget
Get real drunk and ride our bikes
There's so much beauty it could make you cry
There's so much beauty it could make you cry
There's so much beauty it could make you cry
The rich get money but never what they want
Find ourselves a new place to haunt
Climb up the fire escape
Do it 'till the ground looks far away
Go night swimming, leave our clothes on the ground
when we get busted we just stand there proud
It's the truth we all been wrong
Make it up and then let's move on
Playing cards, we all get to act sly
There's so much beauty it could make you cry
There's so much beauty it could make you cry
There's so much beauty it could make you cry
Let loose with your charms
Go reckless, unharmed
We all signed the card:
"Get well, but don't you try too hard"
The lessons unlearned
Oh, this meeting is adjourned
Oh, these Western concerns
Hold my place in line while I get your turn
To the empty balconies we serenade
All the playgrounds where them kids don't get to play
Dirty parkies went and chased them all away
To the game consoles to fatten
The best room they have
Is the last room you want
The bathroom's outside
Police tape is tied
To the doorknobs of rooms
Nine through thirty-two
These Western concerns
We beg while we chew
These Western concerns are all I ever really learned to be concerned with
But don't you, don't you know it's hard
Feeling tired every time that you try?
Ain't it hard feeling tired all the time?
The family living upstairs must have a fleet of rider lawn mowers
While the novelist to my right's convinced that every woman's a whore
But he bothers me time and again
To set him up with my very best friends and I say, "What?!"
Says he doesn't restate but he will not shut up!
Well don't you, don't you know it's hard
Feeling tired every time that you try?
Ain't it hard feeling tired all the time?
Don't you, don't you know
I ain't goin' to bed
Ring my head in the woods right now
Scan for some mycelium
And bring a little back to town
Well don't you, don't you know it's hard (I ain't goin' to bed)
Feeling tired every time that you try? (Ring my head in the woods right now)
Ain't it hard feeling tired all the time? (Scan for some mycelium and bring a little back to town)
Go reckless, unharmed
Yep, the shut-ins, they're well armed
Well, we all led the charge
'Til we ran aground in our party barge
Every little gift was just one more part of their grift
Oh, yeah, we know it
Oh, yeah, we know it
The best news that we got
Was some dumb hokum we'd all bought
Oh, though reckless, feeling great
We're the sexiest of all primates
Let loose with our charms
Shake our ass and wave our arms
All going apeshit
You didn't dye your hair and oh my hair went black
Now what you knew you knew you knew you know what the fuck

But always when I get there
Always when I get there all the pieces they just fall apart
I can't hear you
I can't hear you talk about your dreams involving me
I don't believe
I don't believe that they are any sort of prophecy at all
What a shock it's mister sweet and awful
Don't look so pissed off we all lose the plot occasionally
How consistent
How can someone so consistently mess up as much as
Every instance
How can someone inconsistent mess up so consistently
What a shock it's mister sweet and awful
Tell your gods I want to speak to their fathers
Look right now I'm standing on my haunches

Downpour, downpour
It always rains on a picnic
Downpour, downpour
Don't let go quite yet
Downpour, downpour
uh oh uh oh down low down low etc.
I am not who I want to be
I probably will not ever be
I drove my car on June 14th
I drove it right on down the street
I had not had any sleep
so I ate Minithins to stay awake
you crashed your car right into me

I took a trip down to California
karma payment plan...
k-k-karma's payment plan
k-k-karma's payment plan
my car broke down out in the street
the radiator sprung a leak
I met this guy he said that he could help me
I'm on the karma payment plan.
I'm on the karma payment plan.
we went to his house and did some speed
he said karma would pay for this deed
he got it fixed and he started to scare me
I ditched him eventually
and came back for the van the next morning
I'm in the Karma payment plan
I'm in the Karma payment plan
I went to LA the next day
I got jacked in a really bad way
I cannot tell you but.
it's a long story
This rock of ours is just some big mistake
And we will never know just where we go
Or where we have came from
These veins of mine are now some sort of fuse
And when they light up and my mind blows up my heart is amused
So, this heart of mine is just some sort of map
That doesn't care at all or worry about where the hell you're at
but you're right there
Well, I've been meaning to dismiss you
Yeah, I have some plans to dismiss you
So stand by, by, bye, bye
Wave bye sugar boats
As soon as you paint every last grain of sand
As you, soon as you paint every last star in the sky, sky
Wave goodbye, sugar boats
Well I'm swatting at mosquitoes as they're orbiting me
I'm orbiting the sun and this goes on and on and on you see
This heart of mine is just some broke machine
And when it gets going and it often gets a-going and
It starts blowin' steam
Here we go again
This rock of ours is just some big mistake
And we will never know just where we go
Or where we have come from
This watch of mine is like some sort of void
'Cause when I look in, and I shouldn't look in
I see it swallow my time
Oh no there it goes
I ain't gettin' on no fast plane
Hell I ain't gettin' on no stuffy train
Sugar boats on the Atlantic are fine
The sugar boats they're just fine
I'll stand on the deck so you can see
I'll stand on the deck so you can wave bye
Here's the ghost that goes and waves bye
I'm the ghost that goes and waves bye bye bye
Well, I ain't sure, but I've been told
He's baking cakes inside our souls
Stayed awake, took a nap
Got myself my bottles back
I'm breakin' them out on the street
Walkin' around in my own bare feet
I do not need you to tell me that I am not a cat
I caught a ride, we caught some air
He's never gonna cut his hair
It takes more time to make a fake
We night swam down in the lake
And washed the dirt off our intentions
Prattled on 'bout bad inventions
I came as ice, I came as a whore
I came as advice that came too short
I came as gold, I came as crap
I came clean and I came as a rat
It takes a long time, but God dies too
But not before he'll stick it to you
Well, I don't know, but I been told
You'll never die and you'll never grow old
I came as a call, I came as flat
I came too soon so I came back
I came as flowers, I came as nice
I came as dirt and I came as its price
It takes a long time, but God dies too
But not before he'll stick it to you
I don't know, but I've been told
You never die and you'll never grow old
[ instrumental ]
Walked to your house on my lunch break, here it comes
Come inside and pour a drink, here it comes
You'll probably tell me everything you think, here it comes
The place and the time where we knew everything could go wrong
Grass grows green, could you step away from the screen?
Doesn't mean I don't want you to be seen
Just like everyone
Grass grows green and it's just everyone
You always told me life's a dam that breaks, well, here it comes
If you sit still or if you run, well, here it comes
So now we're drowning in birthday cakes, well, here it comes
The place and the time where we knew everything could go wrong
Keep it clean, I didn't mean to be mean
Why does it always seem like I've never won?
Keep it clean and no one's ever won
The empty promise makers said, here it comes
Make a point to make no sense, well, here it comes
Speak about the future in past tense, here it comes
Don't look down, so what'd we do?
Walking around with shit on my shoes, well, here we come
The place and the time where we knew that things would go wrong
A surf rock band from the land of plenty
Surf rock bands with no surf just pine trees
Struck by being ashamed of your old space, just wanting that mean heat
You bleached your hair and you pawned your skis
And then you sold out for the shade of the palm tree scene
And said, "Oh what a drag, oh what a backwards scheme
'Cuz here things go from grey to grey and back to grey again
And they get green and go to grey and back to grey again"
So he said,
Head South, head South, head South, head South
Head South, head South, head South, head South
Head South, head South, head South, head South
Head South, head South, head South, head South
Struck by being ashamed of your old space, just wanting that mean heat
You bleached your hair and you pawned your skis
And then you sold out for the shape of the palm tree scene
Surrounded, cut off jeans and cut off jeans are what you mean
When you say,
Head South, head South, head South, head South
Head South, head South, head South, head South
Head South, head South, head South, head South
You're standing by the grey ice water
Out in the wind, above the ground, out in the weather
You had yourself a crazy lover
Becoming frozen, trying hard to forget her
You got a job up in Alaska
It's easy to save what the cannery pays
'Cause there ain't nowhere to spend it
You're standing by the grey ice water
Out in the wind, above the ground, out in the weather
You had yourself a crazy lover
Becoming frozen, trying hard to forget her
You took the path of least resistance
On the phone cutting out talking
Short to long distance
At home on a boat, at home it's a fish trap
At home on a boat, it's a fish trap
At home on a boat, it's a fish trap

One wing isn't even enough, it isn't even enough
It isn't even enough, to leave
One wing isn't even enough, it isn't even enough
It isn't even enough, to leave

It wasn't even enough, to leave,
First off Gary was on trial and drunk before we'd left bed
As things got bad it wasn't hard to say that he had no idea
Well I hadn't noticed but the people really noticed that they really didn't want us around
So we all just opened up our mouths and wallets to this town
Well I was walking just a little bit sideways and you were walking sideways too
Well I hadn't learned when a front door can be used, here we go sir
We had darkened doors so we didn't read what the sign read
Though simple enough it was demure and though the ground needs to be fed
Well I hadn't noticed but the people really noticed that they really didn't want us around
So not a single one of us will ever leave town, here we go sir
Our bodies were laid out evenly for fifteen yards
Well two feet above each of our heads was a fly trapped in a jar
Well I hadn't noticed but the people really noticed that they really didn't want us around
So every single one of us fed the ground, here we go now
One wing, one wing, wasn't even enough
One wing, one wing, wasn't even enough
Of part and parcel well it's probably been said
That it's always been said, we were already dead
Does not exist
Take an exit
I hear voices insinuating
Feeds me lyrics to this song that I am saying
Sunlight, 7: 20 PM, early September
Standing looking at a photograph that you do not remember being taken
You look out of breath, and me like I am faking
As a matter of fact I don't recall this photo being taken
You don't even actually exist
So I just started shaking
Does not exist
Take an exit
So you spilled every last penny into the car
And it still won't take you where you want to go
So you spilled every last penny into the car
And it still won't take you very far at all
So you spilled every last penny into the car
And it still won't even barely leave your home
So you spilled every last penny into the car
And it still won't take you where you need to go
So you spilled every last penny into the car
And it still won't even barely leave your home
So you spilled every last penny into the car
And it still won't take you anywhere at all
So you spilled every last penny into the car
And it still won't take you where you want to go
So you spilled every last penny into the car
And it still won't take you very far at all
So you spilled every last penny into the car
And it still won't even barely leave your home
So you spilled every last penny into the car
And it still won't take you where you need to go
So you spilled every last penny into the car
And it still won't even barely leave your home
So you spilled every last penny into the car
And it still won't take you anywhere at all
So you wonder how
get em' up, put em up
get your dukes up now
got no time no money, that's why
get em up, put em up
get your dukes up now
Soda fountain crowd
button up, shut em' up
gettin' fed up now
got no time, no money, no doubt
get em' up, put em' up
get your dukes up, now

I woke up in my own...
I woke up...
Their custom concern for the people
Build up the monuments and steeples
To wear out our eyes
I get up just about noon
My head sends a message for me to reach for my shoes and then walk
Gotta go to work, gotta go to work, gotta have a job
Goes through the parking lot fields
Doesn't see no signs that they would yield and then thought
This'll never end, this'll never end, this'll never stop
Message read on the bathroom wall says,
"I don't feel at all like I fall"
And we're losing all touch, losing all touch, building a desert
Buh duh buh buh buh
Bud duh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh
You go right through me
I go right through but I'm about to
Go on reminding you I am about to see you through it
Buh duh buh buh buh
Bud duh buh buh buh buh duh buh buh
Buh duh buh buh buh
Your mouth not mind is open wide
You don't have a clue
I I am a reminder
You've got a voice so talk to yourself
Lift the bad weight off your mullet
And let the thoughts fall off your tongue
Cause I'm callin' callin' callin'
I've never written to anyone
So this is about ugly lovers
And this is about pretty songs
Cause I'm a bastard bastard bastard
In my lipstick I'm so much fun
Connect your wood feet to a motor
And the chrome dance trophy is won
A little classy plastic lumber
I'm embarassed but I ain't that stunned
Looks like the humans' days are numbered
That's a sitcom that was number one
Cause we're a past tense late rate (?)
I must've thouroughly failed to convince us not to mess this place up
(Shameful shameful shameful)
you read a lot into it
i never even flipped right through it
so what'cha gonna do with
all this stuff thats scribbled to it
you say "theres nothin new"
and oh my god that might be true
but what'cha think youre gonna do
thats worthwhile when theres nothin new
oh my god, i cant see
but it takes half as much as it used to for me
oh my god, i cant see
but it means half as much as it used to to me
you read a lot into it
oh my god that might be true
and what'cha think youre gonna do
with yourself when theres nothin for you
oh my god, i can see
that it takes half as much as it used to for me
you say "theres nothin new"
and oh my god that might be true
but what'cha think youre gonna do
thats worthwhile when theres nothin new
you read a lot into it
i never even flipped right through it
so what'cha gonna do with
all this stuff thats scribbled to you
oh my god, i can see
that it means half as much as it used to for me
you read a lot into
whats spoken word and spoke anew
cause thats what'cha think your gonna do
when second-hand's got second-hand dues
oh my god, i cant eat
and it means half as much as it used to to me
you say "theres nothin new"
and oh my god that might be true
so what'cha think youre gonna do
with yourself when theres nothin new for you
oh my god, i can see
that it takes half as much as it used to for me
Well, I might be a lot of things but I won't be ignored
When I see you coming, the chariots of the Lord
Well, the pale horses are riding and the Judgment Day's at hand
And I'm waiting for the good Lord to take me by the hand
Hey Isaac, this is Spencer
Um, I'm calling about, uh, going to Montana
Um, so you need to give me a ring here
And so we can work out some of those details
And stuff 'cause it could get kind of hairy or whatever
So, uh, give me a call, alright then, bye, bye
Ping-pong
Sit and think for a while and you'll realize that you still die.
If you're not thinking at all I'm not sure why you're alive.

He's 25, hanging out at the high school
Everyone but the butt-rockers knows that aint cool
Got a teen girlfriend and a little mustache
He's got ol' AC/DC coming out of his dash
He's got himself a black Trans Am
Well they build 'em much smaller over there in Japan
Beep, beep, beep on Monday
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep on Tuesday
Too many fiestas for Reuben
Yeah he got drunk and he went cruising
That boy is shot
Two gallons of tequila is what he got
Beep, beep, beep on Wednesday
Beep, beep, beep on Thursday
Beep, beep, beep on Friday
Saturday and Sunday are his days off
On the waydown they saw a lot they don't remember
And if you asked them how, they couldn't say how they got there
And if you want them now, you could just pull on the lever
And say, "I'm hung up on gravity"
You move your mouth and you start to talk
You close your eyes and then lose the thought
What's mine is mine and what's yours
You probably got and we all fall
On the waydown they saw a lot they don't remember
And if you asked them how, they'd say that gravity's how they got there
And if you want them now, you could just pull on the lever
And say, "I'm hung up on this decade"
They found some shelves on a school's sand house
They created pagers to collect all their calls
What's mine is mine and what's yours
And we all always fall and we fall
All those people that you know
All those people that you know
All those people that you know
Floatin' in the river are logs
I could buy myself a reason
I could sell myself a job
I could hang myself on treason
All the folks I know are gone
All the people that you know
All the people that you know
All the people that you know
Floatin' in the river are logs
So I ate the wedding cake
'Til the whole damn thing was gone
And I'm gonna drown the ocean
Now ain't none o' that so wrong?
All the people that you know
All those people that you know
All those people that you know
Gonna take this sack of puppies
Gonna set it out to freeze
Gonna climb around on all fours
'Til all the blood falls out my knees
All the people that you know
All the people that you know
All those people that you know
Floatin' in the river are logs
Well let's take this potted plant
To the woods and set it free
I'm gonna tell the owners
Just how nice that was of me
I could buy myself a reason
I could sell myself a job
I could hang myself on treason
For I am my own damn God

So long to this cold, cold part of the world
So long to this cold, cold part of the world
So long to this bone bleached part of the world
So long to this cold, cold part of the world
So long to this salt soaked part of the world
I stepped down as president of Antarctica
Can't blame me, don't blame me, don't
So long to this sad, sad part of the world
So long, so long...
So long to this sad, sad part of the world
So long, so long...
You're no one
You're going nowhere
You got a fast car

it was on the rotating eyes
it was all on the same postcard
it was all on the same damn shirt
said to sleep in the same Sear's camp house
it was all in the great state parks
it was all on the same Greyhound
it was all so many miles
beneath the dirty brown dirt
twenty miles down the islands
the biggest mall on Earth
it was all in the same rest stop
it was wall on the same damn shirt
it was all on the same Greyhound
sunspots
in the house of the late scapegoat
be aware the paint's still peeling
all muscle cars made of lead
I got myself a fine fine fine fine friend
it was all in the next gray ghost
it was all in the same damn place
the parts to pound attractive
your feeling you owe on your size is bleeding
sunspots

Well all's not well
But I'm told that it'll all be quite nice
You'll be drowned in boots like Mafia
But your feet will still float like Christ's
And I'll be damned
They were right
I'm drowning upside down
My feet afloat like Christ's
I'm in heaven
Trying to figure out which stack
They're going to stuff us atheists into
When Peter and his monkey laugh
And I laugh with them
I'm not sure what at
They point and say
We'll keep you in the back
Polishing halos, baking manna and gas
Well some guy comes in looking a bit like everyone I ever seen
He moves just like Crisco disco
Breath a hundred percent Listerine
He says looking at something else
But directing everything to me
Ever time anyone gets on their knees to pray
Well it makes my telephone ring
And I'll be damned
He said you were right
No one's running this whole thing
He had a theory too
He said that God takes care of himself
And you of you
It's all nice on ice alright
And it's not day
And it's not night
But it's all nice on ice alright
wake-up we're stealing cars
1996 1997 1998 we're all waiting for the year 2000
just the smell on the summer can make me fall in love
we go to the parties listen to the DJ's
dance dance dance and go crazy
she's a party queen an she's in party heaven
her clock is stuck on late
got a first name basis at 7-11
hold the slip slide taste the sweat it's salty
irrigation ditch and a swimming hole
nation-wide loved the movie
We're lucky that
We're lucky that we slept
It didn't seem like we realized we'd be stuck in traffic
We're lucky that
We slept
Not to be confused the points from the purpose
We're lucky that
We're lucky that we're so capable to forget
How lucky we are that we are so easy, so easy to forget
How often we become susceptible to regret I do regret
How often we are confused how honestly we try
but we'll forget
We have designed, have designed, have designed
More unusual things as yet
How often we are confused
How honest we tried
But we'll forget
We'll forget
Won herself a pass to some far off moon
It was second class but what's to lose?
And looking out her window she could more than assume
You can't see air or time
She's the only rocketeer in the whole damn place
They gave her a mirror so she could talk to a face
She still got plenty lonely but that's just the case
With time, time, time
Started hearing voices sometime in June
She knew she could go crazy but didn't think that soon
Now she doesn't feel lonely but she'd just as soon
Try, try, try
Man shot to the moon
I bought a paperback and want to go real soon
I'm shot to the moon
Been here a half an hour and wanna go home soon
I fell in love and
I needed a road map
To find out where you lived
So excited now
Sleepwalking 'cuz I'm sleepwalking
The white trash boys
Listen to the headphones
Blasting white noise
In the convenience store parking lot
I hung around there
Wasting my time
Hoping you'll stop by
'Cuz I'm sleepwalking, I'm sleepwalking
A mutual friend's parents, left town for a week
So we raided their liquor stash
And walked down to the riverside
Sleepwalking 'cuz I'm sleepwalking
Got a racecar grin and a calculation
And every gun for a secret agent
Defunct that timebomb at a space station
Hey, Secret Agent X-9 why don't you drop me a line?
And say, would it cost you your job
To say what was in that gold box?
So why did they give you that job?
Why can they give you that job?
You think this guy was on a permanent vacation
But no he's not, he's a secret agent
Got a racecar grin and a calculation
And every gun for a secret agent
Defunct that timebomb at a space station
Hey, Secret Agent X-9 why don't you drop me a line?
And say, would it cost you your job
To say what was in that gold box?
So why did they give you that job?
Why can they give you that job?
You think this guy was on a permanent vacation
But no he's not, he's a secret agent
Our hearts don't change from pups to dust
Couldn't see clearly, but I had a sense of what right and wrong was
Honest to God, I was honest as hell
I don't lie very often but I lie very well
Give it away, take what you need
Love does not cost money, but it ain't free
We're learning slowly
Equal parts of what you do, you don't
We don't remember
We don't remember just how we got here
Equal parts of what we do, we don't
We don't belong here
We were just born here
We remain the same (I'm not sure about that)
Or pretty much the same (Now that's more like it)
From birth to grave, I couldn't see so clearly what I was or became
Oh, I missed a spot (Scrubba scrubba scrubba scrubba)
On my dirty thoughts
The way we feel about what we do is by who has watched us, so...
Aw, how'd we get here?
Equal parts of what we do, we don't
We don't remember
We were just born here though
Oh, what's the bother?
Equal parts of what you do, you don't
We don't remember
We were just born here
We don't belong here
We were just born here
I feel so anxious mostly all of the time
If there's some point to this then which one is mine?
We really don't belong here, we really ought to wander
We really don't belong here, we really ought to wander
We really don't belong here, we really ought to wander away
I've got my pistol in the car, uh-huh

Everyone's afraid of their own life
If you could be anything you want to be
You'd be disappointed, am I right?
No one really knows the ones they love
If you knew everything they thought
I bet that you'd wish that they'd just shut up
Well, you were the dull sound of sharp math
When you were alive
Not ones gonna play the harp when you die
And if I had a nickel for every damn dime
I'd have half the time, do you mind?
Everyone's afraid of their own lives
If you could be anything you want I bet
You'd be disappointed, am I right, am I right?
And it's our lives
It's hard to remember
It's hard to remember
We're alive for the first time
It's hard to remember
It's hard to remember
We're alive for the last time
It's hard to remember
It's hard to remember
To live before you die
It's hard to remember
It's hard to remember
That our lives are such a short time
It's hard to remember
It's hard to remember
When it takes such a long time
It's hard to remember
It's hard to remember
My mom's God is a woman
And my mom she is a witch
I like this
My hell comes from inside
Comes from inside myself
Why fight this
Everyone's afraid of their own life
If you could be anything you want I bet
You'd be disappointed, am I right?

In heaven everything is fine

Workin' on livin', I'm workin' on leavin', I'm workin' on leavin' the livin'
Love you more than everything, loved it more than anything, loved everything more than anything
Working on drinking, I'm working on driving, I'm working on driving my drinks
Workin' on livin', I'm workin' on leavin', I'm workin' on leavin' the livin'

Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere
Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere
Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere
It's all so plain, it's all a plan
It's all so plain almost everywhere
The sky, it doesn't ever end
The air just gets much thinner further up
You could keep digging down and down
A thousand graves down
Without turning around or finding hell
You find you're digging up again
Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere
Willful suspension of disbelief
Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere
Willful suspension of disbelief
Self pity me, it's so pitiful
You can see that birds and worms don't get along
Self righteous me, it's so wrong and
You can see that we don't have to get along
Self pity me, it's so pitiful
You can see that birds and worms do not agree
And we will crawl
(Will crawl)
Well I just found the fence where I am going to lean
Take my handkerchief out and rub my eyeglasses clean
So I just learned my face, but I forgot my name
I'm gonna wear this smile like it's some stupid toupee
And say "Oh, that's too bad"
Oh, I just learned your face, but it is bound to change
You can say what you want but try to think it my way
And say "Oh, this wicked campaign"
I said, "Oh, this was not my plan"
You know I'm a bastard and we only just met
I guess I probably shouldn't wear this big old sign around my neck
I've still got some opinions that I'm willing to claim
I'm gonna carry them around like they're some wicked campaign
I started the debate, but now I'm sure I can't win
I should, I probably should just exit the same way I came in
Well counted, calculator, you didn't calculate this
That there's a lot more nothing than you knew exists
"Oh, this wicked campaign"
I said, "Oh, this was not my plan"
"Oh, this wicked campaign"
Every day is a wicked campaign
Well I just found the fence where I am going to lean
Take my handkerchief out and rub my eyeglasses clean
And just wait, and just wait, and wait, wait, wait
I'm not dead but I misplaced the will
I'm gonna wear this smile like it's a $100 bill and just wait
I'm not a doctor, but I'll sell you an itch
I could apologize, but then a bit more nothing exists
The world's got plenty of good and bad liars
But our lies should come with chariots and choirs
Singing, "Oh, things are not so bad"
And we sing, "Oh, it's our wicked campaign"
And they sing, "Oh, things are not so bad"
We sing, "Oh, what a wicked campaign"
Hey, haven't seen you around in a while [x4]
I didn't go to work for a month
I didn't leave my bed for eight days straight
I haven't hung out with anyone
'cause if I did, I'd have nothing to say
I didn't feel angry or depressed
I didn't feel anything at all
I didn't want to go to bed
And I didn't want to stay up late
When you're living your life, well, that's the price you pay
Whenever I breath out, you're breathing it in
Whenever I speak out, you're speaking out
I didn't go to work for a month
I didn't leave my bed for eight days straight
I haven't hung out with anyone
'cause if I did, I'd have nothing to say
A wild pack of family dogs came runnin through the yard one day
My father got his gun, shot it up they ran away ok
A wild pack of family dogs came runnin through the yard
And as my own dog ran away with them I didnt say much of anything at all
A wild pack of family dogs came runnin through the yard
As my little sister played the dogs took her away
And I guess she was eaten up ok yeah
""
""
My mothers cryin' blood dust now
My daddy quit his job today
I guess he was fired but thats ok
And I'm sitting outside by my mud lake
Waiting for the pack to take me away
Right after I die, the dogs start running up towards the glowing sky
They will receive their rewards
Hey, haven't seen you around in a while [x4]
I didn't go to work for a month
I didn't leave my bed for eight days straight
I haven't hung out with anyone
'cause if I did, I'd have nothing to say
I didn't feel angry or depressed
I didn't feel anything at all
I didn't want to go to bed
And I didn't want to stay up late
When you're living your life, well, that's the price you pay
Whenever I breath out, you're breathing it in
Whenever I speak out, you're speaking out
I didn't go to work for a month
I didn't leave my bed for eight days straight
I haven't hung out with anyone
'cause if I did, I'd have nothing to say
Rag weed tall, better hope that his ladder don't crack
Or he'll hit the ground low, hard and on to his back
At the battle at the bottom of the ocean, well the dead do rise
You need proof, I got proof at the surface you can watch 'em float by
Way in back of the room, there sits a cage
Inside it's a clock that you can win if you can guess its age
Which you never can do, 'cause the time it constantly change
For lack or luck, I guess that is the saying
On the first page of the book of blue it read
If you read this page then that'll be your death
By then it was too late and you wound up
On an island of shells and bones that bodies had left
And the one thing you taught me about human beings is this
They ain't made of nothing but water and shit
hopped on the wagon, went two feet
now I'm back again
I hit a hard wall
shout two words
I don't understand
Ugly Cassanova Says "Slow down if I Cant"
The Ghost of the haunted inn in the ghost horror(?)
Ugly Cassanova Says "Slow down if I Cant"
Ugly Cassanova Says "Raise it over my Disability,
That Goes for Who I Am Cuz I'm Not trying and get
I Need just who I Please"
Say your sorry oh I Am I Am
Take off again Raise it I Can
Ugly Cassanova Says "Slow down if I Cant"

Every sick fickle fucker
Childhood's what makes you
'Till they treat ya like tundra
Weigh those opinions more like air than lead
Every planned occupation
Surefire disappointment up ahead
Till they treat ya like desert
See mirages of friendship, face turns red
Here's the soon-to-be anchor
Build bridges to nothing, you'll get nowhere
Every governor's mother knows
That their bread is buttered by Sam
And what about science?
They find proof and let you make your own decisions
Every child star wonders
If they have a future up ahead
Every kind-hearted banker
I don't think there is one
Every winning opinion
I wish I had one
Every winning opinion
I wish I had one
Stand on platforms in water
Filling jars full of silence, you'll get nowhere
Daniel read the paragraph he read until the words ran out
It's saying we're all in trouble now
Poison in the juice carafe we drank until our thirst ran out
Oh no! We're in some trouble now
Everyone wants to be a perpetual motion machine
We all try harder as the days run out
We all try harder as the days run out
We all try harder as the days run out
With your teeth to your lips and your head to the ground
Well, you hear the fish and they're making this sound
Saying, "We just want to go on walking around
And feel what it's like to fall down"
Patrick ran the race yeah, he ran until the time ran out
Oh no, I'm in some trouble now
Tried to kick it over, I tried until the juice ran out
Oh no, we want more trouble now
With your teeth to your lips and your head to the ground
Well, you hear the fish and they're making this sound
Saying, "We just want to go on walking around
And feel what it's like to fall down"
I SAW...
[Mumbling]
Everyone wants to be a perpetual motion machine
We all try harder as the days run out
We all try harder as the days run out
We all try harder as the days run out
Well you got the perfect disguise and you're looking okay
From the bottom of the best to the worst, well what can I say
'Cause you cocked your head to shoot me down
And I don't give a damn about you or this town no more
No, but I know the score
Broke my back
Need me to fall down so you can climb up
Some fool ass ladder, well good luck
I hope, I hope there's something better up there
'Cause you cocked your head to shoot me down
And I don't give a damn about you or this town no more
No, 'cause I know the score
Broke my back
To answer a question it'll probably take more
If you're already there well then you probably don't know
Well we were the people that we wanted to know
And we're the places that we wanted to go
It's hard to get hold of and hard to let go
Always something we look for from the day we were born
Instead we're the people that we wanted to know
And we're the places that we wanted to go
Yeah we're the places that we wanted to go
And we're the places that we wanted to go
Always asking a question and I don't want to know
Like the wind across strings that had finally let go
And the people you love but you didn't quite know
And they're the places that you wanted to go
Bark at the neighbors and then bark at the dog
He's sniffling and Whimpering for someone to know
But we were the people that we wanted to know
And we're the places that we wanted to go
Yeah we're the places that we wanted to go
Yeah we're the places that we wanted to go
It was not the intention but we let it all go
Well it messed up the function and sure fucked up the flow
I hardly have people that I needed to know
Cause you're the people that I wanted to know
All this scrambling around hunting high and then low
Looking for a base line or somewhere to go
I hardly have places that I needed to go
Cause you're the places that I wanted to go
Yeah you're the places that we wanted to go
Yeah you're the places that we wanted to go
You're the people that we wanted to know
you shouldn't have to ask
You shouldn't have to ask
Cause we are your real place
gone fishin'
i'm takin'
the path of least resistance.
There's no work in walking and it fueled the talk
I would grab my shoes and then away I'd walk
"Beyond the" stubborn beauty I'd" start at the dawn
Until the sun had fully stopped
Never walking away from
Just a way to pull apart
Dehydrate back into minerals
A life long walk to the
Same exact spot
Carbons anniversary
The parting of the sensory
Old, old news to read
The parting of the sensory
Who the hell made you the boss
We placed our chips in all the right spots, but still lost
Any shithead who had ever walked
Could take this ship and do a much finer job
These fit like clothes made out of wasps
Aw, fuck it I guess I lost
The parting of the sensory
Carbon's anniversary
Just part it again if you please
Carbon's anniversary
Who the hell made you the boss?
If you say what to do I know when not to stop
If you were the ship who would ever get on
The weather changed it for the worse
And came down on us like it had been rehearsed
And like we hope, but change will surely come
And be awful for most but really good for some
I took a trip to the exact same spot
We pulled the trigger, but we forgot to cock
And every single shot
Aw, fuck it I guess we lost
Some day you will die and somehow
Something's going to steal your carbon
Some day you will die and somehow
Something's going to steal your carbon
Well, some day you will die somehow
And something's going to steal your carbon
Some day you will die and someone's
Or something's will steal your carbon
Some day, something will die and
Somehow you'll figure out how
Often you will die somehow and
Something's going to steal your carbon
The thing is you will die
And you will probably just steal it's carbon
Some day you will die somehow
And something's going to steal your carbon
Some day, somehow or something will die
And you will steal it's carbon
Somehow you will die and you'll figure out how
Often you will die somehow
And something's going to steal your carbon
Some day you will die somehow
And someone's going to steal your carbon
Some day you will die and somehow
You'll figure out how often
Some day you will die somehow
And something's going to steal your carbon
You will die and somehow
It's going to steal your
I'd have figure out and find out, we were bathed in carbon
You will figure out that somehow you will
Some day you will die somehow
And something's going to steal your carbon
The parasites are excited when you're dead
Eyes bulging entering your head
and all your thoughts yeah they rot
God And Satan they gamble when you're dead
beams of light one's sprite the other's bourban instead
and all your thoughts yeah they rot
it Was hot and time was sticking to my skin
we're all the punch lines of the jokes they wont let us in on
and all your thoughts yeah they rot
Parasites will be excited when you're dead
Eyes bulging entering in your head
and all your thoughts yeah they rot
God And Satan thay gamble when yer dead
Beams of light one sprite the others bourban instead
and all your thoughts yeah they rot
it Was hot and time was sticking to my skin
we're all the punch lines of the jokes they won't let us in on
and all your thoughts yeah they rot
Ohio, Ohio, Ohio, Ohio, Ohio
Took a bus straight to Baltimore, on the way he took a nap
Dropped off a note that said, "I'm giving this note back"
PS, there's a lot going on underneath
There's roots, there's pipes and there's drainage leaks
You're on, you're wrong
Ohio, Ohio, Ohio, Ohio, Ohio
Truly sorry, I see clearly
Calmly crashing, I pace faster than anyone
Hinges rusting, they swing louder than anything
Truly lonely, this place is flatter than it seems
I'm upset and I leave the door open wide
Our hearts are used up, cracked and dry
Pulled the scabs off of regrets
We haven't learned to read our conscience yet
Truly sorry, I see clearly
Hardly hoping, I spend it all on game machines
Calmly crashing, I pace and I figure it out again
One hand clapping, awake but napping
Rows of lights to illuminate lines
Why don't they turn them off and let us see night
Drove crazed, grooming my lies
You can't look in on one way eyes
Ohio, Ohio, Ohio, Ohio
Ohio, Ohio, Ohio, Ohio
Ohio, Ohio
The streets are just blankets and we sleep on their silky course
Covered up by them, why would we ever wanna wake up?
Oh, no no no
Well, of course, of course, of course, of course
Of course we just did not know
What in hell we're here for?
We just do not know!
Lord lay down, Lord lay down, Lord lay down your own damn soul
Lord lay down, Lord lay down, Lord lay down your own damn soul
Lord lay down, Lord lay down, Lord lay down your own damn soul
The end is like cotton that we wear wherever we go
Covered up by this, why would we ever want to try on your clothes?
Well of course, of course, of course, of course
Of course we just did not know!
Well, Lord lay down, Lord lay down, Lord lay down
(Let down your guard)
Lord lay down, Lord lay down, Lord lay down your own damn soul
Lord lay down, Lord lay down, Lord lay down your only son
Of course we know!
When I can work out how it was
Then I'll tell you
TV stained my memories, yeah
I don't think that she's
Remember through sounds
Remember through smells
Remember through colors
Remember through towns with fear and fascination
On what was here and what's replacing them now
Interchange plazas and malls
And crowded chain restaurants
More housing developments go up
Named after the things they replace
So welcome to Minnow Brook
And welcome to Shady Space
Well it all seems a little abrupt
No I don't like this change of pace
This is how it seems to be
Other people's lives seem more interesting 'cuz they ain't mine
Other people's lives seem more interesting 'cuz they ain't mine
Other people's lives seem more interesting 'cuz they ain't mine
Other people's lives seem much more interesting
Well I'm fed up and I need to go
Out of existence or just down the road forever
Well, later that night on the side of the road
I'm outta gas and I should have known better
Well, a guy shows up, 25 years old
Always stealing kisses, such a mother's boy
He said, and that's what he said
He's been in the army and he did some speed
He went down to Thailand, and he did the deed
Oh, yeah, he did it for the boys
A cop shows up, way damn late
I was excited, but usually I hate to see them
Other people's lives seem more interesting 'cuz they ain't mine
Other people's lives seem more innocent 'cuz they ain't mine
Other people's lives seem more interesting 'cuz they ain't mine
And other people's lives seem more interesting 'cuz they ain't mine
Later that night on the side of the road
I'm out of gas and I should have known better, yeah
I'm fed up and I need to go
Out of existence or just down the road forever, oh, yeah
Well, a guy shows up he's 25 years old
Always steals kisses, such a mama's boy
He said and that's what he said
Palm tree houses, way down lane
I was excited but usually I hate to see them, yeah
[Incomprehensible] overjoyed
On the road, out of road
Going out out of gas
Out of road, out of car
Out of everything at last
Out, out rent a car
Got yourself a crazy walk
I said, bowlegged
[Incomprehensible]
Late at night on the side of the road
I'm out of gas and I should have known better, oh, yeah
Palm tree houses, way down lane
I was excited but usually I hate to see them, yeah
Out of gas and nothing left
[incomprehensible]
Out of gas, out of road
Out of car, I don't know how I'm going to go
And I had a drink the other day
Opinions were like kittens, I was giving them away
I had a drink the other day
I had a lot to say
And I said...
You will come down soon too
You will come down too soon
You will come down soon too
You will come down, you'll come down, come down
You will come down soon too
You will come down too soon
You will come down soon too
Soon enough you will come down, come down
Out of gas, out of road
Out of car, I don't know how I'm going to go
And I had a drink the other day
Opinions were like kittens, I was giving them away
I had a drink the other day
I had a lot to say
And I said...
You will come down soon too
You will come down too soon
You will come down soon too
Soon enough you will come down, come down
You will come down soon too
You will come down too soon
You'll come down, come down
You'll come down, come down
When I can work out how it was
Then I'll tell you
TV stained my memories, yeah
I don't think that she's
Remember through sounds
Remember through smells
Remember through colors
Remember through towns with fear and fascination
On what was here and what's replacing them now
Interchange plazas and malls
And crowded chain restaurants
More housing developments go up
Named after the things they replace
So welcome to Minnow Brook
And welcome to Shady Space
Well it all seems a little abrupt
No I don't like this change of pace
I'm the same as I was when I was 6 years old
And, oh, my God, I feel so damn old, I don't really feel anything
On a plane, I can see the tiny lights below
And, oh, my God, they look so alone, do they really feel anything?
Oh, my God, I've gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta move on
Where do you move, when what you're moving from
Is yourself, is yourself?
The universe works on a math equation
That never even ever really even ends in the end
Infinity spirals out creation
We're on the tip of its tongues, and it is saying
Well, we ain't sure where you stand
You ain't machines, and you ain't land
And the plants and the animals, they are linked
And the plants and the animals eat each other
I'm the same as I was when I was 6 years old
And, oh, my God, I feel so damn old, I don't really feel anything
On a plane, I can see the tiny lights below
And, oh, my God, they look so alone, do they really feel anything?
Oh, my God, I've gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta move on
Where do you move, when what you're moving from
Is yourself, is yourself?

Well, we ain't sure where you stand
You ain't machines, and you ain't land
And the plants and the animals, they are linked
And the plants and the animals eat each other
Well, oh, my God and, oh, my cat
I told my dad what I need
Well, I know what I have and want
But I don't know what I need
Well, he said, he said, he said, he said
"I'm glad we're going, I'm dead"
Stay gone for a while
Stay gone for a while
Stay gone, eyes twitch and thin smile
Stay gone for a while
It takes a needle point and smile
Stay gone for a while
Stay gone twice, twitch and thin smile
Stay gone for a while
It takes a needle point and smile
I'm gone for everyone and for anyone that deserves
I'm gone for everyone and for anyone that deserves
I might and you might
But neither of us do, though
And neither of us will
I broke every bone in my goddamn jaw
That's a lot it's the last one I ever got
I might and you might
But neither of us do, though
And neither of us will
Yesterday night I broke every bone in my jaw
Thought so hard it's the last thing I ever thought
What are you doing here?
I came to get a case of factory outlet beer, then
I go home
I don't feel like I wanna be by myself
Mice eat cheese
And for the most part, they do as they please but
Cat comes home
The mice don't feel very free to walk around
Walk around
Hang it up now or never
Hang it up again
Hang it up now or never
Hang it up again
Hang it up now or never
Hang it up again
Doesn't seem like anything you're saying or doing or doing
Is making any sense
Long distance drunk
Long distance drunk
Long distance drunk
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Hang it up now or never
Hang it up again
Hang it up now or never
Hang it up again
Hang it up now or never
Hang it up again
Doesn't seem like anything you're saying or doing or doing
Is making any sense
Long distance drunk
Long distance drunk
Long distance drunk
Oh yeah, oh yeah
8 AM and someone calls you on the telephone
You want to be by yourself and all alone
Hang it up now or never
Hang it up again
Hang it up now or never
Hang it up again
Hang it up now or never
Hang it up again
Doesn't seem like anything you're saying or doing or doing
Is making any sense
Long distance drunk
Long distance drunk
Long distance drunk
Oh yeah, oh yeah
He don't remember how it got there
He had a number written on his forearm
It spelled disaster
He entered the club scene
All hoping, all hoping for dancing
He was looking, a'looking so stunning
His clothes reflected light, all right
She sat, she sat in the backseat
The car was plush but had no hea
And no, not no one was blushing
Their technique was so damn right, all right
And he read the note in the black light
He thought he read minds and was not right
That line still made him seem charming
His clothes were shining, shining
He don't remember how it got there
He had a number written on his forearm
It spelled disaster
He entered the club scene
All hoping, all hoping for dancing
He was looking, a'looking so stunning
His clothes reflected light, all right
She sat, she sat in the backseat
The car was plush but had no hea
And no, not no one was blushing
Their technique was so damn right, all right
And he read the note in the black light
He thought he read minds and was not right
That line still made him seem charming
His clothes were shining, shining
I got one two three four, five, six, six, six
Running round the neighborhood, pejorative jinx
He said, "The groom's down on me 'cuz he ate the rice"
It was well intentioned but bad advice
Hell yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let it breakthrough, oh let breakthrough
Oh let breakthrough, oh yeah
Let it breakthrough, oh let breakthrough
Oh let breakthrough, oh yeah
Let it breakthrough, oh let breakthrough
Oh let breakthrough, oh yeah
Open the curtain and let in some sky
It's almost half past two and you can tell by the light
Oh yeah, open your window
And let in the atmosphere, oh yeah
Let it breakthrough, oh let breakthrough
Oh let breakthrough
Let it breakthrough, oh let breakthrough
Oh let breakthrough, oh yeah
Open the curtain and let in some sky
It's almost half past two and you can tell by the light
Open your window
And let in the atmosphere, oh yeah
Let it breakthrough, oh let breakthrough
Oh let breakthrough, oh yeah
I was inverted, I mean converted
I mean, I don't understand
I was inverted, I mean converted
I mean, I don't understand
In this life like weeds, you're just a rock to me
You're just a rock to me, you're just a rock to me
And in this life like weeds, you're just a rock to me
And in this life like weeds, in this life like weeds
I could have told you all that I love you
And in the places you go, you'll see the place where you're from
I could have told you all that I love you
And in the faces you meet, you'll see the place where you'll die
I could have told you all that I love you
And on the day that you die, you'll see the people you've met
I could have told you all that I love you
And in the faces you see, you'll see just who you've been
I wish I could have told you all
In this life like weeds, in this life like weeds
Eyes need us to see, hearts need us to bleed
In this life like weeds, you're a rock to me
I know where you're from, but where do you belong?
In this life like weeds, you're the dirt I'll breathe
In this life like weeds, you're a rock to me
In this life like weeds, in this life like weeds
I know where you're from, but where do you belong?
In this life like weeds, eyes need us to see
Hearts need us to bleed in this life like weeds
In this life like weeds, you're the dirt I'll breathe
All this talking all the time and the air fills up, up
Up until there's nothing left to breathe
And you think you feel most everything
And we know that our hearts are just made out of strings to be pulled
Strings to be pulled
So you think you've figured out everything
But we know that our minds are just made out of strings to be pulled
Strings to be pulled
All this talking all the time and the air fills up, up
Up until there's nothing left to breathe
Up until there's nothing left to speak
Up into the better parts of space
And it's true we named our children after towns that we've never been to
And it's true that the clouds just hung around like black Cadillacs outside a funeral
And we were done, done, done with all the fuck, fuck, fuckin' around
You were so true to yourself, you were true to no one else
Well I should put you in the ground
I've got the time, I got the hours I got the days, I got the weeks
I could say to myself I've got the words but I can't speak
Well I was done, done, done with all the circ, circ, circlin' round
I didn't die and I ain't complainin' I ain't blamin' you
I didn't know that the words you said to me meant more to me than they ever could you
I didn't lie and I ain't sayin' I told the whole truth
I didn't know that this game we were playin' even had a set of rules
We named our children after towns that we'd never been to
And it's true that the clouds just hung around like black Cadillacs outside a funeral
And we were laughing at the stars While our feet clung tight to the ground
So pleased with ourselves For using so many verbs and nouns
But we were all still just dumb, dumb, dumber than the dirt, dirt, dirt on the ground
Well wings on flames, kings with no names
Well, this place just ain't got right air right now
You were so all over town but still so Crayola brown
Well you should run 'round yourself right now
And we were done, done, done with all the fuck, fuck, fuckin' around, circlin' round
Self pity me, it's so pitiful
You can see that birds and worms don't get along
Self righteous me, it's so wrong and
You can see that we don't have to get along
Self pity me, it's so pitiful
You can see that birds and worms do not agree
And we will crawl
(Float On)
WOW! said the broken Californian down on the beach that used to be by the beach
TOWN! hasn't moved but it's getting closer losing ground making better views and close relaxing sounds
GROUND! sure don't like the way it's treated so now it's moving back to the sea
PLANS! to hitch a ride with the river cause deep down plumbing life is too cramped for me
I got wood legs and bow legs and no legs at all DAMN would you take a collect call, Oh no I don't understand
I got poor eyes and sore eyes and no eyes at all DAMN! would you like to take the fall, Oh no I don't like this plan
It was a staple of brass tacks and wax backs, oh yeah a message left on the forehead of God
Sent sealed and signed by the saints who sang this song, this song
This song
We're going union like they say
We'll buy the congregation then one day
You'll find us sitting In your chair
With big ideas of stocks and shares
We're going union
We're going union like they say
We'll buy the congregation then one day
You'll find us sitting in your chair
With big ideas of stocks and shares
We're going union
From day to day
To day to day
To today
From day to day
To day to day
To today
We carry, we carry
We carry our own weight
From day to day
To day to day
To today
As sharks in sheep's clothing
Pumping with our hips
Filling every single corner
With our soft little gifts of ourselves
Gettin' carried so
So carried away
I am not afraid
To be dead but it's scary for me to stay
From day to day
To day to day
To today
But
Be brave, be brave, be brave, be brave, be brave
Be brave, be brave, be brave, be brave, be brave
At the Parthenon
Ants were climbing 'round
Every head of bronze
At the Parthenon
Another monster hiding inside of a cave
We go from day to day misbehaving
In the most appropriate ways
The unicorns
Missing last call to get on Noah's ship
We don't quit, we won't quit, we can't quit
We just don't quit
Well the earth doesn't care
And we hardly even matter
We're just a bit more piss to push out its full bladder
And as our bodies break down
Into all their rocky little bits
Piled up under mountains of dirt and silt and still
The world it don't give a shit
But
Be brave, be brave, be brave, be brave, be brave (be brave)
Be brave, be brave, be brave, be brave, be brave (be brave)
Be brave, be brave, be brave, be brave, be brave (be brave)
Ants we're climbing round
All them heads of bronze
At the Parthenon
The ants are climbing on
We won't be sleeping in our autumn beds
We won't be sleeping in our autumn beds
We won't be sleeping in our autumn beds
We won't be sleeping in our autumn beds
October came
Our case got stuck with the DA again
They pulled up the welcome mat
So many times that they hurt their back
As sure as clocks are bleeding time
We'll show up early just to wait in line
We won't be sleeping, we won't be sleeping
We won't be sleeping, we won't be sleeping
As August came
Our case is drawing to an end
They said guilty so many times
All I heard was just the buzzing lights
As sure as lead sinks we're the same
We're just more laundry that they need to hang
We won't be sleeping in our autumn beds
We won't be sleeping in our autumn beds
We won't be sleeping, we won't be sleeping
We won't be sleeping, we won't be sleeping
We won't be sleeping in our autumn beds
We won't be sleeping, we won't be sleeping
We won't be sleeping, we won't be sleeping
We won't be sleeping in our autumn beds
Well all the apostles, they're sitting in swings
Saying I'd sell off my savior for a set of new wings
And some sandals
With the style of straps that cling best to the era
So all of the businessers in their unlimited hell
Where they buy and they sell
And they sell all their trash to each other
But they're sick of it all and they're bankrupt on selling
And all of the angels, they'd sell off your soul
For a set of new wings and anything gold
They remember the people they loved, their old friends
And I've seen through 'em all, seen through 'em all, seen through most everything

Well, I'll go to college and I'll learn some big words
And I'll talk real loud, goddamn right I'll be heard
You'll remember the guy
Who said all those big words he must've learned in college
And it took a long time 'till I came clean with myself
I come clean out of love with my lover
I still love her
Loved her more when she used to be sober and I was kinder
australopithecus, friend to the end and but it's over
over, over again
you wanted to chase around the cat and the dog
while they're playing like that and i said
what's the matter, friend
australopithecus, friend to...
So you brush you hair down
and you let your makeup dry
Stupid
and you let the ball drop
Why did you do it?
Why did you do it?
and you let your bridges burn

She Was a Manic Depressive Named Laughing Boy

Yeah, yes, yes

You could really get it on, you could really get it on
Have I told ya, have I told ya?
Have I told ya, have I told ya?
You could really get it on, you could really get it on
I was at an all night diner
The sign said, Triple X but they were talking about root beer
I'm just sitting down, thinking about nothing
Looking at the thin air, breathing up the oxygen
Have I told ya, have I told ya?
You could really get it on, you could really get it on
A guy comes up, looking pretty 8-ball
Snaggletooth smile, sits down at my table
Puts his arm around me, starts to share his information
He said, he said, he said, he said, he said, this is what he said
I have sex, I'm always thinking about the pavement
So I can avoid premature ejaculation
I got up, remembering to thank him
Better things to do so I'll start drinking
Have I told ya, have I told ya?
Have I told ya, have I told ya?
You could really get it on, you could really get it on
Have I told ya, have I told ya?
Have I told ya, have I told ya?
You could really get it on, you could really get it on
I'm in Tahoka, now I'm gonna hook up
With the parties, unfortunately like always
No one has any ideas, damn
Have I told ya, have I told ya?
Have I told ya, have I told ya?
You could really get it on, you could really get it on
As long as you're gone, I can't apologize

I wanna live in a city with no friends or family
I'm gonna look out the window of my color TV
I wanna remember to remember to forget you forgot me
I'm gonna look out the window of my color TV
Through the cracks in the wall, slow motion for all
Dripped out of the bars, someone smart said nothing at all
I'm watching TV, I guess that's a solution
They gave me a receipt that said I didn't buy nothing
So rust is a fire and our blood oxidizes
My eyes rolled around, all around on the carpet
Hit the deck, it's the decal man
Standing upside down and talking out of his pants
I wanna live in a city with no friends or family
I'm gonna look out the window of my color TV
I wanna remember to remember to forget you forgot me

Hit the deck, it's the decal man
Standing upside down and talking out of his pants
Through the cracks in the wall, slow motion for all
Left holding the ball and a part for your car
I don't know, but I been told
I don't know, but I been told
You never die if you'll never grow old
(Well look at that!
You look so tiny from up here.
Like a cute little bug!)
Whatcha do whatcha do whathca do with your own life

Tongue tip tied to the roof of my mouth
Bad naughty little angels come rushin' out
(Tongue tip tied to the roof of my mouth)
Bad naughty little angels come rushin' out
I guess you guessed that I'd catch hell
I just caught a cold but now I'm feelin' well
(I guess you guessed that I"d catch hell)
I just caught a cold but now I'm feelin well
Well I don't know but I've been told
You never die and you never grow old
(Well I don't know but I've been told)
You never die and you'll never grow old
You said, "I hope you live forever"
Don't you wish that on me, you said, "Don't be clever"
(You said, "I hope you live forever")
Don't you wish that on me, you said, "Don't be clever"
It looked like we were photographed
At gun point so I had to laugh

It's the big show, oh, it's the big show
Three inch horses watching them drown
In the tar pits, kneelin' down
They see us talkin' out both sides of our mouths
Two faced monsters
It's the big show, oh, it's the big show
Three inch horses watching them drown
In the tar pits, kneelin' down
They see us talkin' out both sides of our mouths
Two faced monsters, oh
She ionizes and atomizes
Then turns to sunlight
He realizes and itemizes
Pulls harder than gravity
She ionizes and atomizes
Then turns to sunlight
Flourescent lightbulbs will make
An absense of dark, but
The light just aint there still and she said
"I'm feeling empty,
The real lights can make you heavy but
Never ever really empty
Flourescent lights will always equal empty.
I took the train down to New Mexico
With my father and brother, Ansel
You can't know, well, you can't ever really know
Would you really want to know?
How the hell would you know?
I made a mess of myself and the trip on the whole
My father's good patience with me; why? I don't know
You can't know, you can't ever really know
That's the last time I seen my brother, Ansel
Troubles on the head winds
Troubles on the tail winds
Troubles on the head winds
Troubles on the tail winds
Me and my sister we hung on the phone
Watching the news as they looked for Ansel
On top of that mountain, underneath the snow
They had dogs that were sniffing, I guess you'll never know
You can't know, well, you can't ever really know
Would you really want to know?
How the hell would you know?
You can't know, well, you can't ever really know
Would you really want to know?
How the hell would you know?
The last time that you ever see another soul
No, you never get to know
No, you don't know
Coyotes tiptoe in the snow after dark
At home with the ghosts in the national parks
Mankind's behavin' like some serial killers
Giant ol' monsters afraid of the sharks
And we're in love with all of it
And we say: "What can we say?"
Walking with ghosts in the national parks
Coyotes tiptoe in the snow after dark
And we're in love with all of it
And we say: "What can we say?"
Another branch on the tinder-bound tree
Birds flying lower, lookin' downwards to feed
Mankind's behavin' like some serial killers
Giant ol' monsters, afraid of the sharks
And we're in love with all of it
And we say: "What can we say?"
And we say: "We're in love with all of it"
And we say: "We're in love with everything."
And we say: "What can we say?"
And we say: "We're in love with all of it."
And we say: "We're love with everything."
And we say: "What can we say?"
And we say: "We're in love, with all of it."
And we say: "We're in love, with everything."
And we lie, love to lie
This is the part of me that needs medication
This is the part of me that believes in heaven
This is the part of me that thinks outer space is all dead
This is the part of me that wishes it was with it
This is the part of me that's trying to be funny
This is the part of me that loves my parents
This is the part of me that thinks that ants are cavemen
This is the part of me that thinks all humans are ants
This is the part of me that learns from sitcoms
This is the part of me that means nothing
And I don't know
Well, I could go away and you could wish that I had stayed or just stayed gone
And I don't know
And I don't know at all
So, out of the context and into what you meant
And you know your reasons
You don't know who you are but you know who you wanna be
I don't know
So you go to the library to get yourself a book
And you look and you look
But you didn't find anything to read
And I don't know at all
Left all my kinder parts rusting and peeling
That guy was complaining as he looked at the ceiling
My nose isn't that big, it looks nothing like me
We're all doctors trading sadness for numbness
Grass looks much greener but it's green-painted cement
The mayor's machines are there cleaning the pavement
You can't make dirt clean so we'll just lemon-scent it
A nice heart and a white suit and a baby blue Sedan
And I am doing the best that I can
All the eunuchs, they were standing in rows, singing
Please stud us out just as fast as you possibly can
Sad song, last dance and no one knows who the band was
And Henry, you danced like a wooden Indian
Except this one mattered and I felt it had a spirit
And I shot the stork because I didn't hear it that way
And it's hard to be a human being
And it's harder as anything else
And I'm lonesome when you're around
And I'm never lonesome when I'm by myself
And I miss you when you're around
And I miss you when you're around
And I miss you when you're around
A nice heart and a white suit and a baby blue Sedan
And I am doing the best that I can
All the eunuchs, they were standing in rows, singing
Please stud us out just as fast as you possibly can
Sad song, last dance and no one knows who the band was
And Henry, you danced like a wooden Indian
And it's hard to be a human being
And it's harder as anything else
And I'm lonesome when you're around
And I'm never lonesome when I'm by myself
And I miss you when you're around
And I miss you when you're around
And I miss you when you're around
A nice heart and a white suit and a baby blue Sedan
Wake up, get ready
Wake up, get ready
Such a wonderful trip's ahead
Well wake up, get ready
Wake up, get ready
Such a wonderful trip's ahead
We get dressed as ghosts with sheets taken from the bed
Inside our socks we hide traveler checks
We are tourists of the dead
So let's pack up, let's go
So let's pack up, let's go
So let's pack up, let's go
Let's go
There was this tortoise
Its shell covered with jewels and had been since time began
It knew the world through all its histories and the universe and its mysteries
One day it came across a man
The two were talking
The tortoise offered to tell him about the future and how the universe ran
Oh the man killed the tortoise, took its shell and with a song of his lips walked off again
So let's walk off, let's go
So let's walk off, let's go
So let's walk off, let's go
So let's walk off, let's go
Pack a lunch, wander 'round, toss the map on the ground
It is inaccurate anyway
We've been getting away, We've been getting away
We are strangers to ourselves
We sneak out, drip by drip
Through papercuts on our hands, day after day
Nothing's quite the same
We are tourists in our own heads
So let's walk on, let's go
So let's walk on, let's go
(I think I feel ready to go)
So let's walk on, let's go
So let's walk on, let's go
I think I feel ready to go
I think I feel ready to go
I think I feel ready to go
I think I feel ready to go
I think I feel ready to go
I think I feel ready to go
I'm going to Colorado to unload my head
I'm going to New York City and that's in New York, friends
I'm going to Arizona
Sex on the rocks all warm and red
And we bled
And the writing in the stall said
We write our maps in the stalls
I'm going up to Alaska
I'm going to get off Scot-fucking-free
And we all did
This truckers atlas roads the ways
The freeways and highways don't know
The buzz from the bird on my dash
Road locomotive phone
This truckers atlas roads the ways
The freeways and highways don't know
The buzz from the bird on my dash
Road locomotive phone
I don't feel and I feel great
I sold my atlas by the freight stairs
I do lines and I crossed roads
I crossed the lines of all the great state roads
I'm going up, going over to Montana
You got yourself a trucker's atlas
You knew you were all hot
Maybe you'll go and blow a gasket
You start at the northwest corner
Go down through California
Beeline you might drive three days
Three nights to the tip of Florida
Do you speak the lingo?
Oh oh no
Do you speak the lingo?
No no
How far does your road go?
Oh no, you don't know
I'm going to Colorado to unload my head
I'm going to New York City and that's in New York, friends
I'm going up to Alaska
I'm going to get off Scot-fucking-free
And we all did
And the writing in the salt says
We ride out to the stars
I'm going to Arizona
Sex on the rocks all warm and red
And we all did
This truckers atlas roads the ways
The freeways and highways don't know
The buzz from the bird on my dash
Road locomotive phone

And I said you shouldn't make facts out of opinions
He said that I was right, you're right, I knew that I was
And I'd hate to see anybody fail
But I'd like to see you fail seeing me fail though
I'm not sure who I am
I'm not sure who I am
But I know who I've been
And I said you can't make everybody happy
He said you'd like to at least make yourself happy though
I'm not sure who I am
I'm not sure who I am but I know who I've been
So, turn off the light 'cause it's night on the sun
You're hopelessly hopeless, I hope so, for you
Freeze your blood and then stab it into, in two
Stab your blood into me and blend
I eat my own blood and get filled up, I get filled up
I get filled up on me and end
So turn off the light 'cause it's night on the sun
You're hopelessly hopeless, I hope so, for you
Turn off the light 'cause it's night on the sun

Well, there's one thing to know about this town
It's five hundred miles underground, and that's alright
Well, there's one thing to know about this globe
It's bound and it's willing to explode, and that's alright
That's alright, that's alright
Well there's one thing to know about this town
Not a person doesn't want me underground, that's alright
That's alright, that's alright
There's one thing to know about this town
It's five hundred miles underground, and that's okay, that's alright
There's one thing to know about this earth
We're put here just to make more dirt, and that's okay, that's alright

It's bound and it's willing to explode, and that's okay, that's alright
Well, there's one thing to know about this town
It's five hundred miles underground, and that's okay, that's alright
Night on the sun
Soon the chain reaction started in the parking lot
Waiting to bleed onto the big streets that bleed out onto the highways
And off to other cities, built to store and sell these rocks
Well aren't you feeling real dirty, sitting in the parking lot?
Waiting to bleed onto the big streets that bleed out onto the highways
And off to other cities, built to store and sell these rocks
Well aren't you feeling real dirty, sitting in the parking lot?
Waiting to bleed onto the big streets that bleed out ontp the highways
And off to other cities, built to make and store these rocks
Well aren't you feeling real dirty, sitting in your car with nothing?
Waiting to bleed onto the big streets that bleed out onto the highways
And off to other cities, built to store and sell
There's nothing
Convenient parking is way back, way back
Convenient parking is way back, way back
Convenient parking is way back, way back
Soon the chain reaction started in the parking lot
Waiting to bleed onto the big streets that bleed out onto the highways
And off to other cities, built to store and sell these rocks
Well aren't you feeling real dirty, sitting in the parking lot?
Waiting to bleed onto the big streets that bleed out onto the highways
And off to other cities, built to store these plastic rocks
Well aren't you feeling real dirty, sitting in your car with nothing?
Waiting to bleed onto the big streets that bleed out onto the highways
And off to other cities, built to store and sell these rocks
Well aren't you feeling real dirty, sitting in your car with nothing?

Well I took off running at the greatest speed
I didn't bother lookin' to either side of me
Oh I did't see I just didn't see what was really going on
The trees had stopped and the skyline rose
Exchanging comfort for the more fashionable clothes
I'd left the hills at this point in time
To run on treadmills in a perfect line
Salad days add up to daily shit
Sparking imagination 'til the sparks just quit
And if this is fun why am I so bored with it?
Well I will probably never know
Guilty cocker spaniels eating table scraps
When we rolled over how our master clapped
It felt so good, we wanted more of that
When the program failed they defensively laughed
Saying, "We did things just how you asked
Don't try taking us to task
You didn't bite a face, no just a mask, so Happy Halloween!"
I drew a blank we put it in a frame
Wait, what you're winning, you didn't say this was a game
Well, I guess I'll just have to play and play until I'm outta cash
Before I could spit it out I guess the words had burnt my mouth what can I say?
Best of all I laid it down so you could take it out of context either way
We said all along we deserved every bit
And mostly we knew that the supply would quit
But we got going and going and just went with it
Til everybody lost their minds
Directly behind being ahead of the time
But don't you worry it'll fall right in line
Yup, everything's just fine, fine, fine
No one's getting blamed this time
Blameless oh Blameless can we find a way to blame our way out?
Well, I postdated the eulogy for every blameless body now, now
We are blamelessly teething on much more than we need now, now, now
Blamelessly teething
Well we're all getting blamed cause everyone, everyone knew
Well we're all getting blamed yeah everybody knew
Where to take the blame blame everybody knew
Well the blame blame oh oh everybody knew
Well we're all getting blamed cause everybody knew
Everyone
In heaven everything is fine
In heaven everything's alright
In heaven everything is fine
In heaven everything is fine
In heaven
Working on livin'
I'm working on leaving
I'm working on leaving the living
Love you more than everything
Loved it more than anything
Loved everything more than anything
Working on drinking
I'm working on driving
I'm working on driving my dreams so
Working on living
I'm working on leaving
I'm working on leaving the living
In heaven everything is fine (x4)
In heaven everything's alright (both lines alternating x22)
In heaven everything is fine
In heaven
This plane is definitely crashing
This boat is obviously sinking
This building's totally burning down
And my, and my, and my, and my
And my, and my, and my, and my
And my, and my, and my, and my
And my, and my, and my, and my
And my heart has slowly dried up
You were laying on the carpet like you're satin in a coffin
You said, "Do you believe what you're sayin'?" Yeah right now, but not that often
Are you dead or are you sleepin', are you dead or are you sleepin'?
Are you dead or are you sleepin', god I sure hope you are dead
Well you disappeared so often like you dissolved into coffee
Are you here right now or are there probably fossils under your meat?
Are you dead or are you sleepin', are you dead or are you sleepin'?
Are you dead or are you sleepin', god I sure hope you are dead
Now the blow's been softened since the air we breathe's our coffin
Well now the blow's been softened since the ocean is our coffin
Often times you know our laughter is your coffin ever after
And you know the blow's been softened since the world is our coffin
Well now the blow's been softened since we are our own damn coffins
Well everybody's talkin' about their short lists and everybody's talkin' about DEATH
You were laying on the carpet Like you're satin in a coffin
You said, "Do you believe what you're sayin'?" Yeah right now, but not that often
Are you dead or are you sleepin', are you dead or are you sleepin'?
Are you dead or are you sleepin', god I sure hope you are dead
Well all's not well but I'm told that it'll all be quite nice
You'll be drowned in boots like mafia but your feet will still float like Christ's
Well I'll be damned, they were right
I'm drowning upside down, my feet afloat like Christ's
I'm in heaven trying to figure out which stack
They're going to stuff us atheists into, and Peter and his monkey laugh
And I laugh with them, I'm not sure what at
They point and say we'll keep you in the back, polishing halos, baking manna and gas
Well some guy comes in looking a bit like everyone I ever seen
He moves just like crisco disco, breath 100% Listerine
He says looking at something else but directing everything to me
Anytime anyone gets on their knees to pray, well it makes my telephone ring
And I'll be damned, he said you were right
No one's running this whole thing
He had a theory too
He said that god takes care of himself
God takes care of himself, me or you
He said that god takes care of himself
God takes care of himself, me or you
He said that god takes care of himself
God takes care of himself, me or you
It's all nice on ice, alright
And it's not day
And it ain't night
But it's all nice on ice, alright

I'm gonna dance hall, dance all night long right now
Well, Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He goes to the reservation, drinks and gets mean
And he's gonna start a war
He's gonna start a war
And he hops in his pickup
Puts his pedal to the floor
And says, "I got mine
But I want more"
Because Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He goes to the reservation, drinks and gets mean
He drove the desert, fired his rifle in the sky
And said, "God, if I have to die, you will have to die"
Because Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He didn't move to the city
The city moved to me
And I want out desperately
Can't do it, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
Can't do it, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
Don't know, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
Standing in the tall grass
Thinking nothing
You know we need oxygen to breathe
Oxygen to breathe
Standing in the tall grass
Thinking nothing
You know we need oxygen to breathe
Oxygen to breathe
Every time you think you're walking, you're just moving the ground
Every time you think you're talking, you're just moving your mouth
Every time you think you're looking, you're just looking down
Well, Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He goes to the reservation, drinks and gets mean
He hops in his pickup, puts the pedal to the floor
And says, "I got mine, but I want more"
'Cause Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He goes to the reservation, drinks and gets mean
He drove the desert, fired his rifle in the sky
And said, "God, if I have to die, you will have to die"
Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He goes to the reservation, drinks and gets mean
He didn't move to the city, the city moved to me
And I want out desperately
Can't do it, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
Can't do it, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
No, no, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
Yeah, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
We're going down the road towards tiny cities made of ashes
I'm gonna hit you on the face, I'm gonna punch in your glasses
Oh, no
I just got a message that said yeah, hell has frozen over
I got a phone call from the Lord saying hey boy, get a sweater
Right now
So we're drinking, drinking, drinking, drinking Coca, Coca-Cola
I can feel it rollin' right on down, oh right on down my throat
And as we're headed down the road towards tiny cities made of ashes
I'm gonna get dressed up in plastic, gonna shake hands with the masses
Oh no!
Does anybody know a way that a body could get away?
Does anybody know a way?
Does anybody know a way that a body could get away?
Does anybody know a way?
We're going down the road towards tiny cities made of ashes
I'm gonna hit you on the face, I'm gonna punch you in your glasses
I'm wearing myself a T-shirt that says the world is my ashtray
Our hearts pump dust and our hair's all gray
And I just got a message that says yeah, hell has frozen over
I got a phone call from the Lord saying hey boy get a sweater
Right now!
Does anybody know a way that a body could get away?
Does anybody know a way?
Does anybody know a way?
We're drinking, drinking, drinking, drinking Coca, Coca-Cola
I can feel it rollin' right on down my, oh right on down my throat
And as we're heading down the road towards tiny cities made of ashes
I'm gonna lay down at the spa where they coat you in molasses
What now?
Does anybody know a way that a body could get away?
Does anybody know a way?
Does anybody know a way that a body could get away?
Does anybody know a way?
I hope that you like it in your little motel
And I hope that the suite sleeps and suits you well
Well I can see it as time and as sight through smell
And that's why it's nice to be by yourself
Cause that's what I'm waiting for, that's what I'm waiting for
That's what I'm waiting for, aren't I?
That's what I'm waiting for, that's what I'm waiting for
That's what I'm waiting for darlin'
We treat mishaps like sinking ships
And I know that I don't want to be out to drift
Well I can see it in your eyes like I taste your lips and
They both tell me that we're better than this
Cause that's what I'm waiting for, that's what I'm waiting for
That's what I'm waiting for, aren't I?
That's what I'm waiting for, that's what I'm waiting for
That's what I'm waiting for darlin'
We trade tit for tat like that for this
And I don't think that there was an insult that was missed
I can see it in your eyes like I taste your lips
And I'm very sorry
Cause that's what I'm waiting for, that's what I'm waiting for
That's what I'm waiting for, aren't I?
That's what I'm waiting for, that's what I'm waiting for
That's what I'm waiting for darlin'
Remainders of a shooting star
Landed directly on our broke down little car
Before then we had made a wish
That we would be missed
If one or another just did not exist
Cause that's what we're waiting for, that's what we're waiting for
That's what we're waiting on aren't we?
That's what we're waiting for, that's what we're waiting for
That's what we're waiting on aren't we?
That's what we're waiting for, that's what we're waiting for
That's what we're waiting for darlin'
That's what we're waiting for, that's what we're waiting for
That's what we're waiting for aren't we?
Call it education it was somewhere in between
You gave me some sound advice but I wasn't listening
After we had capsized I couldn't tell you how you'd fall
Well, I'm not sure if I'd laid to rest on the ceiling or the wall
Not quite conversation it was somewhere in between
You said everything is taught and I listened patiently
All this dog and pony still monkeys the whole time
We could not help from flinging shit in our modern suits and ties
Our instincts, they were cringing about how we lived our lives
It didn't seem we'd lived enough to even get to die
All these dense distractions so beautifully complex
Well, I love life's surprises so much I don't want to know what's a-hea-head
Stubborn shouted and said "I don't do what you do" I don't know,
Could it really hear highly if you highly care? And you don't
Stubborn beauty, stubborn beauty, oh, very well
Hardly education it was somewhere in between
Oh, I hit the roof but I had aimed for the ceiling
Hardly education all them books I didn't read
They just sat there on my shelf looking much smarter than me
Good old Nostradamus he knew the whole damn time
There'd always be an east from west and someone is there fighting
Stubborn shouted and said "I don't do what you do" I don't know,
Could it really hear highly if you highly care? And you don't
Stubborn beauty, stubborn beauty, oh, very well
Stubborn beauty, stubborn beauty I don't know anyway
Stubborn beauty, stubborn beauty I don't know
Could it really hear highly if you highly care? and you don't
Stubborn beauty, stubborn beauty uh, oh, very well, then
Stubborn beauty, stubborn beauty oh, very well, then
Stubborn beauty, stubborn beauty oh, very well, then
Stubborn beauty, stubborn beauty oh, very well, then
Oh, very well, then
I was in heaven, I was in hell, believe in neither but fear them as well
This one's a doctor, this one's a lawyer, this one's a cash fiend taking your money
Back of the Metro, ride on the Greyhound, drunk on the Amtrak, please shut up
Another rider, he was a talker talking about TV, please shut up
This one's a crazer, daydreaming disaster the origin of junk food, rutting through garbage
Tasty but worthless, dogs eat their own shit we're doing the cockroach, yeah
Doin' the cockroach yeah, doin' the cockroach yeah, yeah alright not bad
Doin' the cockroach yeah, doin' the cockroach yeah, yeah alright not bad
Doin' the cockroach yeah, doin' the cockroach yeah, yeah alright not bad, not bad at all
One year, twenty years, forty years, fifty years down the road in your life
You'll look in the mirror and say My parents are still alive
You move your mouth, you shake your tongue you vibrate my eardrums
You're saying words But you know I ain't listening
You're walking down the street your face, your lips, your hips, your eyes, they meet
You're not hungry though
Well late last winter down below the equator they had a summer that would make you blister
Oh, my mind is all made up so I'll have to sleep in it
Well late last winter down below the equator they had a summer that would make you blister
Oh, my mind is all made up so I'll have to sleep in it
Well late last winter down below the equator they had a summer that would make you blister
And oh, my mind is all, oh, my mind is all oh, my mind is all made up so I'll have to sleep in it
Broke account so I broke a sweat
I've bought some things that I sort of regret about now
Broke your glasses, but it broke the ice
You said that I was an asshole and I paid the price
Broken hearts want broken necks
I've done some things that I want to forget but I can't
Broke my pace and ran out of time
Sometimes I'm so full of shit that it should be a crime
Broke a promise cause my car broke down
Such a classic excuse it should be bronze by now
Broke up, and I'm relieved somehow
It's the end of the discussions that just go round and round
And round, and round, and round, and round, and round, and round
It shouldn't have been anyway, no way, no way, no way, that's right
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh no
It was like everything was evidence of broken time
You're living on fancy wine
You'll drink that turpentine
You're starting conversations
You don't even know the topic
Well, Jesus Christ was an only child
He went down to the river and he drank and smiled
And his dad was oh, so mad
Should have insured that planet before it crashed
Working real hard to make internet cash
Work your fingers to the bone sitting on your ass
I know now what I knew then
But I didn't know then what I know now
Penny found out as her hair was styled
You should hide your kids while the dogs run wild
Jesus Christ was an only child
He went down to the river and he drank and smiled
And his dad was oh, so mad
Should have killed that little fucker before he even had
Well, Jesus Christ was an only child
He went down to the river and he drank and smiled
And his dad was oh, so mad
Should have insured that planet before it crashed
Working real hard to make internet cash
Work your fingers to the bone sitting on your ass
Penny found out as her hair was styled
You should hide your kids while the dogs run wild
I know now what I knew then
But I didn't know then what I know now
Well, I know what what I knew then
Yeah, I know now what I knew then
Yeah, I know now what I knew then
But I didn't know then what I know now
If food needed pleasing you'd suck all the seasoning off, suck it off
Well treat me like the disease, like the rats and the fleas, ah ha ha, ah ha ha
Bang your head like a gong 'cause it's filled with all wrong
Ha ha ha, clang clang clang
If you think you know enough to know you know, you know we've had enough
And if you think you don't, you probably will
Our tails wagged and then fell off
But we just turned back, marched into the sea
Well treat me like the sea, oh-so salty and mean, ah ha ha, oh ha ha
Well treat me like disease, like the rats and the fleas, ah ha ha ahhh
I'll be beating my heart's record for speeding
I'll be beating the record for heart skipping
In the dark, our tails wagged and then fell off
But we just turned back, marched into the sea
Well we just turned round, marched into the sea
Take all that you need like my sign says for free, till its gone, till it's gone
Well discard whom you please like the leaves off a tree ah-ha-ha, a ha ha
Let's shake hands if you want, but you, both hands are gone, ah ha ha, ha ha
Well treat me like the sea, oh-so salty and mean, ah ha ha
Oh treat me like the sea, oh-so salty and mean, ah ha ha
Well treat me like the leaves, like the rats and the fleas
Bang your head like a gong 'cuz you call it all wrong
Move your tongue, klank klank, klank klank, klank klank, klank klaaaaank
Cut me down like the trees, like the lumber or weeds
Drag me out of the sea and then teach me to breathe
Give me forced health till I wish death on myself
Give me forced health till I wish death on myself
Ah ha ha! Ah ha! Ah ha! AH HA! AHAAAAAH!
Well we all stumbled round tangled up in the cords
From our phones, VCRs and our worldly woes
Ah ha ha, march on, march on, march on, march on
Well, march on!
If you break these moth wing feelings
Powdery dust on your fingers
Well no we're not praying we're kneeling
Hard enough just to say you believe them
Well how the heck did you think you could beat them
At the same time that you're trying to be them
Hard enough just to say you don't need it
When they serve it up well you will still eat it
Well satellite, satellite skin
Just enough just to say you don't mean it
Well everybody's willing to listen
Oh satellite, satellite skin
You can say what you want, you're forgiven
Well happy fucking congratulations
Well everyone, everyone wins
Just like being my own solar system
Doing good things but then totally eclipse them
Oh what the use, oh what the hell
If you break these moth wing feelings
Butterfly knives in the ceiling
Well everyone, everyone's waiting
Detachments gets praised and completed
You can say what you want and not mean it
When no one really seems to be waiting
If you sweep up this mess I've created
Nothing's left to show I existed
Oh satellite, satellite skin
Asking for a question, was it easier said than was actually done
Do you even believe that, do you even believe that there's a race to be won
If you break these moth wing feelings I have seen it all become satellite skin over innocent eyes
I'd like to know these morbid opinions get stacked in all those usual avoided spots
Just to tell you I could not have seen through to the gist of those unhappy, happy accidents
Your gun went off
Well you shot off your mouth and look where it got you
My mouth runs on too
Shouts from both sides
Well we've got the land but they've got the view!
Well now here's the clue
Life it rents us
And yeah I hope it put plenty on you
Well I hope mine did too
As life gets longer, awful feels softer well it feels pretty soft to me
And if it takes shit to make bliss well I feel pretty blissfully
Your gun went off
Well you shot off your mouth and look where it got you
My mouth runs on too
Shouts from both sides
Well we've got the land but they've got the view!
Well now here's the clue
We are fixed right where we stand
Life it rents us
And yeah I hope it put plenty on you
Well I hope mine did too
We are fixed right where we are
As life gets longer, awful feels softer well it feels pretty soft to me
And if it takes shit to make bliss well I feel pretty blissfully
(For every invention made how much time did we save?)
(We're not much farther than we were in the cave)
As life gets longer, awful feels softer and it feels pretty soft to me
And if it takes shit to make bliss well I feel pretty blissfully
If life's not beautiful without the pain
Well I just would rather never ever even see beauty again
Well as life gets longer, awful feels softer and it feels pretty soft to me
(For every good deed done there is a crime committed)
We are fixed
(For every step ahead we could have just been seated)
We are fixed
As life gets longer, awful feels softer well it feels pretty soft to me
We are fixed
And if it takes shit to make bliss well I feel pretty blissfully
We are fixed
We are fixed
We are fixed
We are fixed right where we stand
In the last second of life
They're gonna show you how
How they run this show
Sure, run it into the ground
The stars are projectors, yeah
Projecting our life down to this planet earth
The stars are projectors, yeah
Projecting our minds down to this planet earth
Everyone wants a double feature
They wanna be their own damn teacher
And how all the stars are projectors, yeah
Projecting our lives down to this planet earth
It's all about the moderate climates
You gotta be cold and be hot for sure
It's all about the moderate climates
You wanna be blessed and be cursed, for sure
And the stars are projectors, yeah
Projecting our lives down to this planet earth
And the stars are projectors, yeah
Projecting our lives down to this planet earth
Everyone wants a double feature
They wanna be their own damn teacher
And how all the stars are projectors, yeah
Projecting our minds down to this planet earth
You've got the harder part
You've got the kinder heart and it's true
I've got the easy part
I've got the harder heart, ain't this true?
Right wing, left wing, chicken wing
It's built on finding the easier ways through
God is a woman and the woman is
An animal, that animal's man and that's you
Was there a need for creation?
That was hiding in a math equation and that's this
Where do circles begin?
Spent 18 hours
Waitin' stoned for space
I spent the same 18 hours
In the same damn place
I'm on a road
Shaped like a figure 8
I'm goin' nowhere
But I'm guaranteed to be late
You go out like a riptide
You know a ball has no sides
You're an angel with an amber halo
Black hair and the Devil's pitchfork
Wind-up anger with the endless view of
The ground's colorful patchwork
How have you been? How have you been?
How have you? How have you?
I drove around for hours
I drove around for days
I drove around for months
And years and never went no place
We're on a pass, we're on a pass
I stopped for gas, but where could place be
To pay for gas to drive around
Around the Interstate 8
You go out like a riptide
You know a ball has no sides
You're an angel with an amber halo
Black hair and the Devil's pitchfork
Wind-up anger with the endless view of
The ground's colorful patchwork
How have you been? How have you been?
How have you? How have you?
Last night you know I couldn't sleep
I was tossing, turning, and counting sheep
To tell the truth
The next thing I knew
I woke up on the outside
In the middle of the avenue
A policeman spied me traffic there
In my t-shirt and my underwear
He said, son, son
It sure don't look good
The way you've been calling for your baby
All over the neighborhood
It seems I was sleepwalking
Again last night
The way I was sweet talking
It must have caused a terrible fright
Last night when I was sleepwalking
Someone saw me at a doughnut shop
I was sitting, crying on a tabletop
It was not a pretty sight
I was out of control
The way that I was carrying on
About my sweet jelly roll
I said officer please
My baby's got me down on my knees
Lying in bed
Late at night
Sometimes I just go out of my head
At night
And I go out sleepwalking
Later on down at the jail cell
I was hoping things would turn out well
Because I don't recall
That masquerade ball
And I don't remember nothing y'all
About that blown up rubber doll
So lately I've stopped going anywhere
And I've taken to sleeping with a teddy bear
It's a very full and rich
Imaginary life
And it's sure enough better than dreaming y'all
About any imaginary wife
Yeah, yes, yes, have I told ya
You could really get it on?
I was at an all night diner
The sign said, triple X
But they were talking about root beer
I'm just sitting down, thinking about nothing
Looking at the thin air
Breathing up the oxygen
Have I told ya
You could really get it on?
A guy comes up, looking pretty 8-ball
Snaggletooth smile, sits down at my table
Puts his arm around me, starts to share his information
He said, he said, he said
He said, he said, he said
He said, he said, he said
He said, he said, he said
This is what he said
I have sex, I'm always thinking about the pavement
So I can avoid premature ejaculation
I got up, remembering to thank him
Better things to do so I'll start drinking
I'm in Tahoka, now I'm gonna hook up
With the parties, unfortunately
No one has any ideas, damn
Have I told ya
You could really get it on?
Everything that keeps me together is falling apart
I've got this thing that I consider my only art of fucking people over
My boss just quit the job says
He's goin' out to find blind spots and he'll do it
The third planet is sure that they're being watched
By an eye in the sky that can't be stopped
When you get to the promise land
Your gonna shake that eyes hand
Your heart felt good it was drippin' pitch and made of wood
And your hands and knees felt cold and wet on the grass to me
Outside naked, shiverin' looking blue
From the cold sunlight that's reflected off the moon
Baby cum angels fly around you, reminding you
We used to be three and not just two
And that's how the world began
And that's how the world will end
A third had just been made and we were swimming in the water
Didn't know, then was it a son was it a daughter
When it occurred to me that the animals are swimming
Around in the water in the oceans, in our bodies
And another had been found, another ocean on the planet
Given that our blood is just like the Atlantic
And how the universe is shaped exactly like the earth
If you go straight long enough, you'll end up where you were
This song is also known as the older name: "Your Life"
Everyone's afraid of their own life
If you could be anything you want
I bet you'd be disappointed, am I right?
No one really knows the ones they love
If you knew everything they thought
I bet you'd wish that they'd just shut up
Well you were the dull sound of sharp math when you were alive
No one's gonna play the harp when you die
And if I had a nickel for every damn dime
I'd have half the time, do you mind?
Everyone's afraid of their own lives
If you could be anything you want
I bet you'd be disappointed, am I right?
Am I right, am I right, am I right?
Am I right, am I right, am I right?
It's our lives
It's hard to remember, it's hard to remember
We're alive for the first time
It's hard to remember, it's hard to remember
We're alive for the last time
It's hard to remember, it's hard to remember
To live before you die
It's hard to remember, it's hard to remember
That our lives are such a short time
It's hard to remember, it's hard to remember
When it takes such a long time
It's hard to remember
It's hard to remember
My mom's God is a woman and my mom, she is a witch
I like this
My hell comes from inside, comes from inside myself
Why fight this?
Everyone's afraid of their own life
If you could be anything you want
I bet you'd be disappointed, am I right?
Well I ain't sure, but I've been told he's baking cakes inside our souls
Stayed awake, took a nap, got myself my bottles back
I'm breaking them out on the street, walking around in my bare feet
I do not need you to tell me that I am not a cat
I caught a ride, we caught some air, he's never gonna cut his hair
It takes more time to make a fake, we night swam down in the lake
And washed the dirt off our intentions
Prattled on about bad inventions
I came as ice, I came as a whore
I came as advice that came too sure
I came as gold, I came as crap
I came clean and I came as a rat
It takes a long time, but God dies too
But not before he'll stick it to you
Well I don't know, but I been told
you'll never die and you'll never grow old
I came as a call, I came as flat
I came too soon so I came back
I came as flowers, I came as nice
I came as dirt and I came as a surprise
It takes a long time, but God dies too
But not before he'll stick it to you
I don't know, but I been told
you'll never die and you'll never grow old
Oh gotta see, gotta know right now
What's that riding on your everything?
It isn't anything at all
Oh gotta see, gotta know right now
What's that writing on your shelf?
In the bathrooms and the bad motels
No one really cared for it at all
Not the gravity plan
Early, early in the morning
It pulls all on down my sore feet
I wanna go back to sleep
In the motions and the things that you say
It all will fall, fall right into place
As fruit drops, flesh it sags
Everything will fall right into place
When we die, some sink and some lay
But at least I don't see you float away
And all the spilt milk, sex and weight
It all will fall, fall right into place
Oh gotta see, gotta know right now
What's that riding on your everything?
It isn't anything at all
Early, early in the morning
It pulls all on down my sore feet
I wanna go back to sleep
In the motions and the things that you say
It all will fall, fall right into place
As fruit drops, flesh it sags
Everything will fall right into place
When we die, some sink and some lay
But at least I don't see you float away
Woke up this morning, it seemed to me that every night turns out to be
A little bit more like Bukowski and yeah, I know he's a pretty good read
But God who'd wanna be, God who'd wanna be such an asshole?
God who'd wanna be, God who'd wanna be such an asshole?
Well we sat on the edge of the river, the crowd screamed, "Sacrifice the liver"
If God takes life, he's an Indian giver, so tell me now why, you'll tell me never
Who would wanna be, who would wanna be such a control freak?
Well who would wanna be, who would wanna be such a control freak?
Well see what you wanna see, you should see it all
Well take what you want from me, you deserve it all
Nine times out of ten our hearts just get dissolved
Well I want a better place or just a better way to fall
But one time out of ten everything goes perfect for us all
Well I want a better place or just a better way to fall
Here we go
If God controls the land and the seas, and keeps a watchful eye on me
If he's really so damn mighty, well my problem is I can't see
Well who would wanna be, Who would wanna be such a control freak?
Well who would wanna be, Who would wanna be such a control freak?
Evil home stereo, what good songs do you know?
Evil me, oh yeah, I know, what good curves can you throw?
Well all that icing and all that cake
I can't make it to your wedding but I'm sure I'm gonna be at your wake
You were talk, talk, talk, talkin' in circles that day
When you get to the point make sure that I'm still awake, OK?
I went to bed and didn't see why every day turns out to be
A little bit more like Bukowski and yeah, I know he's a pretty good read
But God who'd wanna be, God who'd wanna be such an asshole?
hahaha I love this shit
Well!
Well!
Well!
Well!
We spun like birds on fire right down towards the residence
And I, I took all that I desired even crooks have to pay the rent
We swam like rats on fire right, right down the reservoir
We took all that we could carry but we tried to carry more
And you know, you know, you know it all went wrong
And you know, you know, you know it was all wrong
We choked on straight tap water, well I'm going to have to try the real thing
I, I took your life by the collar and it knew not to swing
Any time I tried an honest job well, the till had a hole and ha-ha
We laughed about paying rent because the county jail's debt free
And you know, you know, you know it was all wrong
You know, you know, you know it was all wrong
Deep water, deep water senseless denial
I went down like a rag doll as you would, child
Well, deep water, deep water senseless denial
I went down like a rag doll as you would, child
Well, Oh lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky me again I said it looks like it's time to use my feet again
Well I just spent my last one hundred dollars God, I'll pay my bill again oh this is. huh huh huh huh Oh, I don't care
Huh huh huh huh Oh, how I just don't care
Deep water, deep water senseless denial
I went down like a rag doll, shooken and shy
Oh deep water, deep water senseless denial
Oh I went down like a burnt out rat of a child
Well, King Rat has me on his list again, I can never be on the fence again
Well, I found out it's all loud open like an organ and it talk, talk, talk, talk, talk again
Well, honest even when I cheated them that I could owe them my heart
Well, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky me again
Oh deep water, deep water this senseless denial
I got fed like a fish, full of open smiles
Oh well, blue water, deep water oh, senseless denial
I got fed a fist by that con, fuck smiles
Well, well, what do you have to say for yourself?
I said, well, well, well, I said well, well, well, well, well!
Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky me again I hardly knew I should use my feet again
What do you have to say for yourself, what do you have to say for yourself?
Uneasey melody
Some grunting
I'm really digging
I'm really digging
I hope you're dead
I hope you're dead
I'm really digging
I'm really digging
I hope you're dead
I hope you're dead
While we're on the subject
Could we change the subject now?
I was knocking on your eardoors
But you were always out
Looking towards the future
We were begging for the past
Well, we know we had the good things
But those never seemed to last
Oh, please just last
Everyone's unhappy
Everyone's ashamed
Well, we all just got caught looking
At somebody else's page
Well, nothing ever went
Quite exactly as we planned
Our ideas held no water
But we used them like a dam
Oh, and we carried it all so well
As if we got a new position
Oh, and I laugh all the way to hell
Saying yes, this is a fine promotion
Oh, and I laugh all the way to hell
Of course everyone goes crazy
Over such and such and such
We made ourselves a pillar
We just used it as a crutch
We were certainly uncertain
At least I'm pretty sure I am
Well, we didn't need the water
But we just built that good god damn
Oh, and I know this of myself
I assume as much for other people
Oh, and I know this of myself
We've listened more to life's end gong
Than the sound of life's sweet bells
Was it ever worth it?
Was there all that much to gain?
Well, we knew we'd missed the boat
And we'd already missed the plane
We didn't read the invite
We just danced at our own wake
All our favorites were playing
So we could shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Tiny curtains open
And we heard the tiny clap of little hands
A tiny man would tell a little joke
And get a tiny laugh from all the folks
Sitting, drifting around in bubbles
And thinking it was us that carried them
When we finally got it figured out
That we had truly missed the boat
Oh, and we carried it all so well
As if we got a new position
Oh, and we owned all the tools ourselves
Without the skills to make a shelf with
Oh, what useless tools ourselves
The good times
Yes
Release The good times
The good times are killing me
The good times are killing me
Here we go!
Got dirt, got air, got water and I know you can carry on
Shrugged off, shortsighted, false excitement and oh what can I say?
Have one, have twenty more "one mores" and oh it does not relent
The good times are killing me
Kick butt, buzz cut, dickheads who didn't like what I said
The good times are killing me
Jaws clenched tight, we talked all night, oh but what the hell did we say?
The good times are killing me
The good times are killing me
The good times are killing me
Fed up with all that LSD
Need more sleep than coke or methamphetamines
Late nights with warm, warm whiskey
I guess the good times they were all just killing me
Got dirt, got air, got water and I know you can carry on
The good times are killing me
Enough hair of the dog to make myself an entire rug
The good times are killing me
Have one, have twenty more "one mores" and oh it does not relent
The good times are killing me
Shit kicker, city slickers who all wanted me dead
The good times are killing me
Get sucked in and stuck in late nights with more folks that I don't know
The good times are killing me ([The good times are killing me])
The good times are killing me
The good times are killing me ([The good times are killing me])
The good times are killing me
The good times are killing me ([The good times are killing me])
The good times are killing me
The good times are killing me ([The good times are killing me])
([The good times are killing me])
Well, it would've been, could've been worse than you would ever know
Oh, the dashboard melted, but we still had the radio
Oh, it should've been, could've been worse than you would ever know
Well, you told me about nowhere well it sounds like someplace I'd like to go
Oh, it could've been, should've been worse than you would ever know
Well, the windshield was broken but I love the fresh air y'know
(The dashboard melted but we still had the radio)
Oh, it would've been, could've been worse than you would ever know, oh!
(The dashboard melted but we still had the radio)
Oh, we talked about nothing which was more than I wanted you to know-oh-oh-oh-oh
Now here we go!
Oh! It would've been, could've been worse than it had even gone
Well, the car was on blocks, but I was already where I want
(It was impossible, we ran it good, we ran it good)
Why should we ever even ever really even get to know?
(It was impossible, we ran it good, we ran it good)
Oh if the world don't like us it'll shake us just like we were a co-oh-oh-oh-old
Now here we go!
Well we schemed and we schemed but we always blow it
we've yet to crash, but we still might as well tow it
Standing at a light switch to each east and west horizon
Every dawn when you're surprising and the evening was consoling
Saying "See it wasn't quite as bad as"
Well, it would've been, could've been worse than you would ever know
I was patiently erasing and recording the wrong episodes
after you had proved my point wrong, it wasn't like I'd let it go, oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh
I just wanted to catch the last laugh of this show
Yeah, it would've been, could've been worse than you would ever know
Oh, the dashboard melted, but we still had the radio
(The dashboard melted, but we ran it good, we ran it good)
Hard-wired to conceive, so much we'd have to stow it
Even needs have needs, tiny giants made of tinier giants
Don't wear eyelids so I don't miss the last laugh of this show
(The dashboard melted but we still had the radio)
Well, we could've been, should've been worse than you would ever know
(The dashboard melted but we still have the radio)
Well, you told me about nowhere well it sounds like someplace I'd like to go-oh-oh-oh-oh
Now here we go!
Well we schemed and we schemed but we always blow it
we've yet to crash, but we still might as well tow it
Standing at a light switch to each east and west horizon
Every dawn when you're surprising, and the evening was consoling
Saying, "See it wasn't quite as bad as"
Hey! it would've been, could've been worse than you would ever know
Etceterenough, etceterenough
Etceterenough, etceterena.da da dadadadadadada da
Etceterenough, etceterenough
Etceterenough, etcet.dadadadadadada
Fire it up, fire it up
When we finally turn it over
Make a beeline towards the border
Have a drink, you've had enough
Fire it up, fire it up
If you need some conversation
Bring a magazine to read around
Our broke down transportation
Fire it up
Etceterenough, etceterenough
Etceterenough, etcet.dadadadadadada
Fire it up, fire it up
When we find the perfect water
We'll hang out on the shore
Just long enough to leave our clothes then
Find enough, find enough
Oh we ate all of the oranges
Off the navels of our lovers
Grabbed a book and read the cover
It honestly was beautifully done
Like trying to hide the daylight from the sun
Even if we had been sure enough it's true we really didn't know
Even if we knew which way to head but still we probably wouldn't go
Fire it up, fire it up
We pushed off we're rolling boulders
Crashing down the mirrored stairways
Two of life's best mine canaries
Fire it up, fire it up
When we fix the carburetor
Then we'll push off once again
In an hour or so later
It honestly was beautifully bold
Like trying to save an ice cube from the cold
Even if we had been sure enough it's true we really didn't know
Even if we knew which way to head but still we probably wouldn't go
Well we always, well we always
had it a-all, had it a-a-a-all
Well we always, well we always
had it a-all, had it a-a-a-all
Well we always, Well we always
had it a-all
Traveling, swallowing Dramamine
Feeling spaced, breathing out Listerine
I'd said that I'd said what I'd tell you
And that's you've killed the better part of me
If you could just milk it for everything
I've said what I said and you know what I mean
But I still can't focus on anything
We kiss on the mouth but still cough down our sleeves
Traveling, swallowing Dramamine
Look at your face like you're killed in a dream
And you think you've figured out everything
I think I know my geometry pretty damn well
You say what you need so you'll get more
If you could just milk it for everything
I've said what I said and you know what I mean
But I still can't focus on anything
Your body may be gone I'm gonna carry you in
In my head in my heart in my soul
And maybe we'll get lucky and we'll both live again
Well I don't know I don't know I don't know don't think so
Well that is that and this is this
You tell me what you want and I'll tell you what you get
You get away from me
You get away from me
Collected my belongings and I left the jail
Well thanks for the time I needed to think a spell
I had to think awhile
I had to think awhile
The ocean breathes salty won't you carry it in
In your head in your mouth in your soul
And maybe we'll get lucky and we'll both grow old
Well I don't know I don't know I don't know I hope so
Well that is that and this is this
You tell me what you want and I'll tell you what you get
You get away from me ()
You get away from me
Collected my belongings and I left the jail
Well thanks for the time I needed to think a spell
I had to think awhile ()
I had to think awhile
Well that is that and this is this
Well you tell me what you saw and I'll tell you what you missed
When the ocean met, the sky ()
You missed when time and life shands and said goodbye ()
When the earth folded in on itself ()
And said good luck, for your sake I hope heaven and hell ()
Are really there, but I wouldn't hold my breath ()
You wasted a life, why wouldn't you waste death ()
You wasted a life, why wouldn't you waste death
The ocean breathes salty won't you carry it in
In your head in your mouth in your soul
The more we move ahead the more we're stuck in rewind
Well I don't mind, I don't mind, how the hell could I mind
Well that is that and this is this
You tell me what you want and I'll tell you what you get
You get away from me ()
You get away from me
Well that is that and this is this
Will you tell me what you saw and I'll tell you what you missed
When the ocean met, the sky ()
You wasted a life why wouldn't you waste the afterlife
Ice-age heat, wave can't complain
If the world's at large, why should I remain?
Walked away to another plane
Gonna find another place, maybe one I can stand
I move on to another day
To a whole new town with a whole new way
Went to the porch to have a thought
Got to the door and again, I couldn't stop
You don't know where and you don't know when
But you still got your words and you got your friends
Walk along to another day
Work a little harder, work another way
Well uh uh baby I ain't got no plan
We'll float on maybe would you understand?
Gonna float on maybe would you understand?
We'll float on maybe would you understand?
The days get shorter and the nights get cold
I like the autumn but this place is getting old
I pack up my belongings and I head for the coast
It might not be a lot but I feel like I'm making the most
The days get longer and the nights smell green
I guess it's not surprising but it's spring and I should leave
I like songs about drifters, books about the same
They both seem to make me feel a little less insane
Walked on off to another spot
I still haven't gotten anywhere that I want
Did I want love? Did I need to know?
Why does it always feel like I'm caught in an undertow?
The moths beat themselves to death against the lights
Adding their breeze to the summer nights
Outside, water like air was great
I didn't know what I had that day
Walk a little farther to another plane
You said that you did, but you didn't understand
I know that starting over is not what life's about
But my thoughts were so loud, I couldn't hear my mouth
My thoughts were so loud, I couldn't hear my mouth
My thoughts were so loud
